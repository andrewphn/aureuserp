## 👥 Role-Specific Tag Cheat Sheets

### For BRYAN (Owner) 👔

**Your Daily 5-Minute Dashboard:**
```
Filter: Priority = "Critical" OR "High"
        AND Health = "Red Flag" OR "At Risk" OR "Blocked"
```
Shows only projects needing your attention (should be <15 projects).

**Your Weekly Strategic Review:**
```
Filter: Any project with 2+ Risk tags
        OR Complexity = "Master"
        OR Health = "Budget Watch" OR "Schedule Watch"
```

**Your Decision Rules:**
- See "Red Flag"? Ask David for mitigation plan
- See "Critical Priority"? Check if resources need reallocation
- See 3+ projects "Blocked"? Systemic issue, fix root cause

---

### For DAVID (Project Manager) 📋

**Your Daily Task Priorities:**
1. All "Blocked" projects → resolve blockers first
2. "Critical Priority" projects → next in queue
3. "High Priority" projects → after critical
4. Check "Budget Watch" + "Schedule Watch" → prevent escalation

**Your Weekly Tagging Routine:**
- **Monday:** Review all project health tags, update based on weekend progress
- **Wednesday:** Check all risk tags, add new risks identified
- **Friday:** Update priority tags based on next week's deadlines

**When to Escalate to Bryan:**
- Any "Red Flag" health status
- Any project with 3+ risk tags
- Any "Critical Priority" that's also "Blocked"

**Auto-Apply Rules:**
- 3+ design revisions → add "Design Risk"
- GC or designer involved → add "Coordination Risk"
- Deadline <2 weeks → add "Schedule Watch"

### For MIGUEL (Lead Craftsman) 🔨

**Your Production Planning Filter:**
```
Filter: Work Scope = "Custom Cabinetry" OR "Architectural Millwork"
        AND Complexity = "Advanced" OR "Master"
        AND Health ≠ "Blocked"
```

**Your Team Assignment Rules:**
- **Standard Complexity:** Assign to Carlos, Ben, or journeymen
- **Advanced Complexity:** You oversee, journeymen execute
- **Master Complexity:** You lead the entire build

**Your Quality Checkpoints:**
- All "Master Complexity" → prototype phase required
- All "Advanced Complexity" → mid-build inspection
- All "Standard Complexity" → final QC only

**When to Flag Design Risk:**
- Drawing details unclear or incomplete
- Material specs not feasible to execute
- Timeline doesn't match complexity

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Don't:** Make everything "Critical Priority"
✅ **Do:** Reserve Critical for true emergencies (<20% of projects)

❌ **Don't:** Let "Blocked" projects sit without daily follow-up
✅ **Do:** Review all blocked projects every morning

❌ **Don't:** Apply complexity tags based on project value
✅ **Do:** Apply based on actual build difficulty

❌ **Don't:** Forget to remove "At Risk" when resolved
✅ **Do:** Update health tags weekly minimum

❌ **Don't:** Use tags instead of communication
✅ **Do:** Use tags to support communication (still talk to people!)
