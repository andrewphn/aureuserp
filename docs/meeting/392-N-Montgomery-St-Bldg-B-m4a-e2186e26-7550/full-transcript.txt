Bryan (00:04-00:14): So yeah, so they're going to take the hardware from the wall and put it allocated into one of the job boxes for hardware and then it's done until it needs to get shipped out.
Bryan (00:14-00:16): It's allocated, can't be touched.
Bryan (00:16-00:25): For sheet goods, we're going to keep a livestock of commonly used things, which is really becoming just pre finished plywood.
Bryan (00:25-00:26): All other things.
Bryan (00:28-00:30): Well, when Chase is gone, we might have job base.
Bryan (00:31-00:35): If we don't have job base, we're going to just label it on the side when it gets received for which job it's for.
Andrew (00:36-00:42): Okay, so the input here is a bill of materials.
Andrew (00:42-00:42): Yeah.
Andrew (00:42-00:44): Now let's talk.
Andrew (00:44-00:45): You be the inventory guy.
Bryan (00:45-00:46): Yeah.
Andrew (00:46-00:47): What are your jobs?
Bryan (00:48-00:49): I receive a bill of materials.
Andrew (00:49-00:50): Yeah.
Bryan (00:50-00:51): I'm going to go out.
Bryan (00:51-00:52): I have a hardware section.
Bryan (00:53-00:55): I'm first going to go through the hardware and see what we have on.
Andrew (00:55-00:56): The floor that's available.
Bryan (00:56-01:00): Start allocating it into the current job flag.
Bryan (01:00-01:03): We need six slides.
Bryan (01:03-01:03): We have three.
Bryan (01:03-01:04): I have to order three.
Andrew (01:04-01:05): Okay.
Andrew (01:05-01:08): So they have to check current inventory and report.
Andrew (01:09-01:10): That's the first thing I have to do.
Andrew (01:11-01:12): Okay, so just mark it on the board.
Andrew (01:12-01:18): So check current inventory report and report under report.
Andrew (01:18-01:23): Put update master and then just put allocation.
Andrew (01:25-01:27): Okay, so if they need to order how.
Andrew (01:27-01:28): What is the current.
Andrew (01:28-01:31): Do they produce a purchase order request?
Andrew (01:31-01:32): Who approves that?
Andrew (01:32-01:33): How does that work?
Bryan (01:34-01:35): Yeah, I probably should approve it.
Andrew (01:36-01:42): Okay, so you need if yes, then approved by Brian before and then buy.
Andrew (01:42-01:49): Yes, arrow down approved by Brian and then the answer is buy.
Andrew (01:53-01:57): Update purchase orders here.
Andrew (01:57-01:58): Yep.
Bryan (01:58-01:58): Update.
Andrew (01:59-01:59): Yeah.
Andrew (02:02-02:03): Purchase orders.
Andrew (02:03-02:04): Is it bol.
Andrew (02:04-02:05): No.
Andrew (02:05-02:06): Purchase orders.
Andrew (02:06-02:07): Okay.
Andrew (02:07-02:11): Because we should have them making people pos.
Andrew (02:12-02:13): Because the pos.
Andrew (02:13-02:14): What you read.
Andrew (02:16-02:20): Okay, that makes sense because that's the only way to do it, to take it out of your hands.
Andrew (02:20-02:21): Right.
Bryan (02:21-02:25): Now the current bill of materials really is kind of both.
Bryan (02:25-02:26): Because it doesn't need a.
Bryan (02:26-02:27): It doesn't need a price.
Andrew (02:27-02:28): No, it doesn't.
Andrew (02:28-02:29): A bill of materials is.
Andrew (02:29-02:33): This is what, this is what the designer who has no idea about price says that we need for the job.
Andrew (02:33-02:34): You get the bill of materials.
Andrew (02:34-02:37): You can also look at the project plans and go.
Andrew (02:37-02:39): We don't actually need that much.
Bryan (02:39-02:39): Yeah.
Andrew (02:39-02:40): And then you.
Andrew (02:40-02:40): So you'll get.
Andrew (02:40-02:42): So Brian gets the bom.
Andrew (02:43-02:46): He gets the project file and he gets the purchase order request.
Andrew (02:48-02:48): Cool.
Andrew (02:49-02:53): If you don't need to order it, you still need to update current inventory.
Andrew (02:54-02:56): So allocate, just write allocate there.
Andrew (03:01-03:02): Okay.
Andrew (03:02-03:06): So what we haven't put into this pipe is money.
Andrew (03:08-03:13): We agreed that you would have the money before you bought the junk.
Andrew (03:15-03:15): Money is here.
Bryan (03:15-03:17): Money 30% received.
Andrew (03:17-03:19): So that was enough to cover.
Andrew (03:19-03:20): Yeah.
Andrew (03:20-03:21): Okay, cool.
Andrew (03:21-03:21): All right, cool.
Andrew (03:30-03:34): Okay, so at the end of purchase, they put a purchase order.
Andrew (03:34-03:35): Now receiving it.
Andrew (03:35-03:38): So draw a line under that just under sourcing.
Andrew (03:39-03:40): Just cross.
Andrew (03:40-03:42): Make another section a box just for receiving.
Andrew (03:42-03:43): Yeah.
Andrew (03:43-03:43): Okay.
Andrew (03:43-03:44): How do we receive?
Andrew (03:45-03:47): Now the things that we have on the purchase order come in.
Andrew (03:47-03:49): What do you want them to do?
Bryan (03:50-03:51): Label the sheets.
Andrew (03:52-03:52): Okay.
Bryan (04:02-04:06): Allocate hardware.
Andrew (04:12-04:12): Okay.
Andrew (04:16-04:18): Okay, what's next?
Andrew (04:18-04:20): So label sheets, allocate hardware.
Andrew (04:20-04:22): They also have to update everything.
Andrew (04:22-04:24): So update master inventory.
Andrew (04:24-04:26): Update project inventory.
Andrew (04:27-04:33): So I think that bill of materials will be our checklist as well.
Andrew (04:33-04:37): So update BoM and update Master inventory.
Bryan (04:38-04:39): Okay.
Andrew (04:55-04:56): And now what?
Andrew (04:58-04:58): What's the stat?
Andrew (04:58-04:59): How do we.
Andrew (04:59-04:59): Status change.
Andrew (05:01-05:01): So.
Andrew (05:01-05:07): So a sourcing report needs to be done at the end of sourcing A.
Andrew (05:07-05:08): The BOM needs to be.
Andrew (05:08-05:10): Which is the bomb just needs a.
Bryan (05:10-05:11): Checkbox at the bottom.
Andrew (05:11-05:14): It not just needs to be checked, but needs to say where it is.
Andrew (05:16-05:19): Where it's been allocated in one bay in what?
Andrew (05:19-05:19): Blah, blah.
Andrew (05:19-05:21): So that production guy.
Bryan (05:22-05:24): So the bottom of the bomb could be that.
Andrew (05:24-05:25): Yeah.
Bryan (05:26-05:28): Almost like you have like the finishing report at the bottom.
Andrew (05:28-05:29): Yep.
Andrew (05:31-05:34): She wants me to pull a bench super fast.
Andrew (05:35-05:36): Do it yourself, man.
Bryan (05:36-05:37): Dude, I tried.
Andrew (05:39-05:40): Paper sk.
Bryan (05:40-05:41): John, you're doing the.
Andrew (05:41-05:42): The oak top.
Andrew (05:42-05:43): That long one.
Bryan (05:43-05:44): Yeah, crazy long one.
Andrew (05:44-05:45): 105.
Andrew (05:45-05:46): I thought.
Bryan (05:47-05:48): Four.
Bryan (05:48-05:49): I'm going to give you two.
Bryan (05:49-05:50): Where's the J. Pulpus?
Andrew (05:50-05:51): Yeah.
Bryan (05:52-05:55): 1:05.
Andrew (05:55-05:56): No, that's the inside.
Andrew (05:59-06:00): Oh, it is.
Andrew (06:00-06:00): It would.
Bryan (06:00-06:02): No, it would be the outside because it's going to go.
Bryan (06:02-06:02): Yeah.
Andrew (06:02-06:03): 108.
Bryan (06:03-06:05): This is whatever that face turn is.
Bryan (06:05-06:05): Yeah.
Bryan (06:06-06:08): 108 by 25 deep.
Bryan (06:09-06:11): 24 and a half deep.
Bryan (06:12-06:19): Control P. I'm gonna give you another oak one while you're doing those.
Bryan (06:19-06:22): If you want to glue up gardener all those.
Bryan (06:25-06:28): All that stuff that daggert Skip planned to like 7, 8.
Bryan (06:28-06:29): That was all banana.
Bryan (06:29-06:30): And he was all worried about.
Andrew (06:32-06:32): Make.
Bryan (06:32-06:33): These little tops with.
Bryan (06:33-06:35): Because they gotta finish at three quarter.
Bryan (06:37-06:41): I feel like I saw Levi doing that.
Bryan (06:42-06:43): There's a ton of them on this job.
Bryan (06:43-06:45): So he has not started these ones yet.
Bryan (06:48-06:49): 26.
Bryan (06:49-06:50): Reed's different.
Bryan (06:58-07:03): 26 by 19 and a quarter.
Bryan (07:04-07:05): Three quarter thick.
Bryan (07:09-07:12): There's a total of four of them needed.
Bryan (07:12-07:12): Same time.
Andrew (07:13-07:13): Yeah.
Bryan (07:13-07:14): Same size.
Bryan (07:14-07:17): Bullnose, three sides, furniture piece.
Bryan (07:17-07:18): No scribe.
Bryan (07:22-07:22): Full nose.
Andrew (07:23-07:23): Yes.
Bryan (07:23-07:25): He's got that set up.
Bryan (07:25-07:25): Yeah.
Andrew (07:38-07:39): Paper out.
Bryan (07:40-07:40): Paper out.
Bryan (07:56-07:58): James is coming over to watch Lions game this weekend.
Andrew (07:58-07:59): Yes.
Bryan (07:59-08:00): Fair sad.
Bryan (08:01-08:02): Were they playing?
Bryan (08:02-08:04): They're supposed to crush where they're playing.
Andrew (08:05-08:08): Well, I hope they do it.
Andrew (08:10-08:11): I really thought they were doing better than CEO.
Andrew (08:12-08:13): Yeah.
Andrew (08:13-08:14): Yeah.
Andrew (08:14-08:15): You said 24 and a half.
Bryan (08:17-08:19): Making 24 and a half.
Andrew (08:19-08:19): Yeah.
Bryan (08:19-08:20): So that one's unspread.
Bryan (08:24-08:24): It's weird.
Bryan (08:24-08:25): I wonder why.
Bryan (08:25-08:26): This one needs spread.
Bryan (08:27-08:28): Oh, you're right.
Bryan (08:28-08:29): Because it's got solid back.
Bryan (08:30-08:31): Probably doesn't need to be.
Andrew (08:31-08:32): Need to be 24.
Andrew (08:32-08:33): They could probably be a little less.
Andrew (08:35-08:36): You want it to be flush with this or come out.
Bryan (08:36-08:38): It's going to be flush with that.
Andrew (08:40-08:41): But you're really using.
Bryan (08:41-08:43): So just at least behind that.
Andrew (08:43-08:43): Yeah.
Bryan (08:43-08:45): So if you're at 23 quarter.
Andrew (09:18-09:19): Okay.
Bryan (09:21-09:24): So to leave sourcing at the bottom of the page of the BOM will be a.
Bryan (09:24-09:29): Something gets filled out either by hand or maybe digitally that would affect other things.
Bryan (09:29-09:31): Where it says, like, everything's been received.
Bryan (09:31-09:32): This is the bay that it's in.
Andrew (09:33-09:33): Yeah.
Andrew (09:33-09:36): I think they should just get a fresh bomb.
Bryan (09:37-09:39): They should just get at the end.
Andrew (09:39-09:39): Yeah.
Andrew (09:39-09:40): Or it's on their job card.
Bryan (09:41-09:43): Or it's on their job card.
Andrew (09:43-09:46): Because they don't care about all the other information.
Andrew (09:46-09:48): They just need to know where to go to get the things they need.
Andrew (09:48-09:49): Do we have it?
Bryan (09:49-09:57): The only people who really need any information from this is the CNC guy and the person packing the trailer that the hardware's in.
Andrew (09:58-10:01): Are we ever building with hardware attached?
Bryan (10:01-10:02): Rarely.
Bryan (10:02-10:03): Pretty rarely.
Andrew (10:05-10:08): I think the production guy there is.
Andrew (10:09-10:14): That's part of his job to finish and add the hardware to the pack and put it in a bag and all like strapped to the thing.
Andrew (10:15-10:19): He needs to know what sheets are allocated to me.
Andrew (10:21-10:21): Yeah.
Andrew (10:22-10:25): So we need to produce a finalized bomb, basically.
Andrew (10:26-10:27): Okay, so just put that at the bottom.
Andrew (10:27-10:30): That's the output now from there.
Andrew (10:31-10:33): Yeah, just put finalized bomb.
Andrew (10:41-10:41): Okay.
Andrew (10:41-10:42): You are Levi now.
Andrew (10:43-10:44): You have the Levi hat on.
Andrew (10:45-10:46): What am I getting?
Bryan (10:46-10:51): Need a job card which has not been made yet.
Andrew (10:52-10:53): We'll come to that.
Andrew (10:53-10:54): Right, Shotgun?
Andrew (10:54-10:55): Yeah.
Andrew (10:59-11:01): Well, no, it's not Levi.
Andrew (11:02-11:03): It's the project manager.
Andrew (11:05-11:06): It's not Levi the worker.
Andrew (11:06-11:12): It's the production manager, which is you or whoever that production manager is.
Andrew (11:12-11:14): They don't have a job card.
Andrew (11:14-11:15): They're not receiving a job card.
Andrew (11:15-11:16): Job card is part of part.
Andrew (11:17-11:18): This is the office work.
Andrew (11:19-11:21): So a job card needs to be created.
Andrew (11:21-11:24): That's a product that we need.
Andrew (11:24-11:24): Let's put.
Andrew (11:24-11:25): Put job card halfway down the board.
Andrew (11:26-11:27): Is your pen running out?
Bryan (11:31-11:32): Seems like it's okay.
Andrew (11:37-11:39): Okay, so he's receiving what?
Andrew (11:40-11:42): He's receiving CNC files.
Andrew (11:44-11:44): Okay.
Andrew (11:44-11:45): Yeah.
Andrew (11:48-11:50): What else is he reading?
Andrew (11:50-11:51): Receiving a PDF of what?
Andrew (11:53-11:54): What plans?
Andrew (11:54-11:54): What?
Andrew (11:54-11:56): What is he receiving a Rhino file.
Andrew (11:56-11:58): He's receiving a Rhino file.
Bryan (11:58-11:58): Yeah.
Andrew (11:58-11:59): Okay, cool.
Andrew (12:04-12:09): And he probably needs a PDF because he won't have a laptop out there.
Andrew (12:10-12:12): Like, what does production need to complete this job?
Bryan (12:12-12:15): You're saying this is the office portion of its job.
Andrew (12:15-12:15): Correct.
Andrew (12:15-12:21): But like the guy on the floor, what does he need apart from the job card?
Andrew (12:21-12:22): Because he still needs the drawings.
Andrew (12:22-12:27): He needs the bill of materials to know what he can use in production.
Andrew (12:27-12:31): There's a crew member that needs CNC files because he needs to go cut.
Andrew (12:31-12:33): What else does the production floor need?
Andrew (12:36-12:38): It's probably IT and a PDF drawing.
Bryan (12:39-12:41): But that is the Rhino file.
Andrew (12:41-12:43): Not if you're on the floor, it's not.
Bryan (12:43-12:45): You have to have the Rhino file at this point.
Andrew (12:45-12:46): I get it.
Andrew (12:46-12:46): You.
Andrew (12:46-12:48): You need it in addition, so you can verify.
Andrew (12:48-12:50): But you can't use a Rhino flow file.
Bryan (12:50-12:53): That's a job card that you get to print out.
Andrew (12:55-12:59): I would say it's up there, like job card is.
Andrew (12:59-13:03): When you have all those things, then you make the job card and the bundle you get.
Andrew (13:03-13:11): But part of that bundle is the architectural drawing or whatever drawing it is, because it's not on that.
Andrew (13:11-13:13): The PDF isn't on the job card.
Andrew (13:13-13:14): It is.
Andrew (13:15-13:15): Write down.
Bryan (13:16-13:17): Yeah, these ones.
Andrew (13:19-13:20): Correct.
Andrew (13:20-13:22): But that's not the job card.
Andrew (13:22-13:24): That's a PDF of the drawing.
Andrew (13:25-13:26): That's a separate item.
Andrew (13:26-13:27): It's just in the bundle.
Bryan (13:28-13:28): This.
Andrew (13:28-13:29): This is.
Andrew (13:29-13:30): The job card is on your left.
Bryan (13:30-13:33): And this is a snapshot from Rhino.
Andrew (13:33-13:33): Correct.
Andrew (13:33-13:39): So we just need to make sure that we have a printed drawing.
Bryan (13:40-13:42): This isn't on the printed drawings.
Bryan (13:44-13:49): What we've sent as a printed drawing to a client doesn't have any of the.
Andrew (13:49-13:51): No, I'm saying, so what are the drawings?
Andrew (13:52-13:54): What are the visual things that needs to add it to the list?
Andrew (13:55-13:57): Because that is not a Rhino's file.
Andrew (13:57-13:58): This is the Rhino file.
Bryan (13:58-14:03): This is the exact problem that Sadie was wanting to solve by doing the job cards.
Bryan (14:03-14:10): We're not going to print a file that is 26 pages of 36 x 24s at this juncture.
Andrew (14:10-14:10): No.
Andrew (14:10-14:15): So we can make a PDF though, and then only print a relevant section.
Bryan (14:15-14:17): The PDF is already made.
Bryan (14:18-14:19): It's what went to the client.
Andrew (14:19-14:19): No, no.
Bryan (14:20-14:20): So.
Andrew (14:20-14:22): But the production team also needs that PDF.
Bryan (14:23-14:23): Yeah, that's fine.
Bryan (14:23-14:24): So it's already made.
Andrew (14:24-14:26): I'm saying put it in the list.
Andrew (14:26-14:27): I'm just saying put it in the list.
Bryan (14:28-14:29): PDF.
Andrew (14:29-14:30): Yeah.
Andrew (14:30-14:31): That's all I want you to write up.
Andrew (14:31-14:33): And you're like, I don't know why he's fighting me on this.
Bryan (14:33-14:35): Because it's not needed.
Andrew (14:35-14:37): 100% it's needed.
Andrew (14:37-14:38): Why is it needed?
Andrew (14:38-14:43): I am asking you what a guy on the floor needs to do the job.
Bryan (14:45-14:47): He needs the job cards, which is.
Andrew (14:47-14:49): Only the front page, by the way.
Bryan (14:51-14:52): So it's just an overview of the job.
Andrew (14:53-14:53): Yeah.
Andrew (14:53-15:00): So what you're holding is a task job card or a cabinet level job card.
Andrew (15:00-15:04): But the job card is that front page only.
Andrew (15:05-15:07): The rest of it is what's behind it.
Andrew (15:07-15:08): So he needs all that stuff.
Andrew (15:08-15:11): So we need to export from Rhino.
Andrew (15:13-15:15): Those are the pages at design.
Bryan (15:17-15:22): So then you have to make the job cards at design because they're extremely specific.
Andrew (15:23-15:25): You can start that.
Andrew (15:25-15:27): This needs a job card.
Bryan (15:27-15:28): Yes, you could do that.
Andrew (15:28-15:30): So I put that in design then.
Bryan (15:30-15:31): So that is what.
Andrew (15:33-15:39): Actually no, I would put at the start of production because it is a separate task.
Andrew (15:39-15:41): You could technically break those tasks apart.
Andrew (15:41-15:43): I just need someone to go back and review the files.
Bryan (15:45-15:48): It's making job cards, what you're doing at that point.
Andrew (15:48-15:51): Yeah, but it's not just making job cards because it's.
Andrew (15:51-15:52): Oh, no, it is making jobs.
Andrew (15:52-15:53): Yeah.
Andrew (15:53-15:53): Correct.
Andrew (15:53-15:54): Yeah, 100%.
Andrew (15:54-15:55): So make job cards.
Andrew (16:00-16:02): I wouldn't call it a job card make.
Andrew (16:04-16:08): It is a job card, but it's a bundle, which is all of that stuff.
Andrew (16:10-16:14): There needs to be a bundle that can just be handed over and it has everything you need in there.
Andrew (16:15-16:17): It should be all details except financial.
Andrew (16:18-16:24): Basically, like from the floor, I should be able to.
Andrew (16:24-16:26): Let's say that we missed a step along the way.
Andrew (16:26-16:35): If I'm Levi, I should be able to walk straight back to the inventory person and not talk to you and go, hey, dude, you said all these things.
Andrew (16:35-16:36): You ordered all these things.
Andrew (16:36-16:38): I don't see them on the list.
Andrew (16:38-16:40): So that's the right.
Andrew (16:40-16:43): Like you have to empower them to do without coming back to you.
Andrew (16:43-16:49): So what is everything that we know to give to the guys on the floor to build the thing?
Andrew (16:49-16:50): What am I missing?
Andrew (16:50-16:50): Is that everything?
Andrew (16:53-16:54): Yeah.
Andrew (16:54-16:56): Okay, so how do we make job cards?
Andrew (16:56-16:57): Let's go to job cards.
Andrew (16:57-16:58): So make tasks.
Andrew (16:58-16:59): Break down that process.
Andrew (17:00-17:01): How do you want to break them down?
Bryan (17:02-17:06): So it's directly related to labeling.
Bryan (17:06-17:09): So you Label a cabinet, desk 01.
Bryan (17:10-17:15): The tasks for this is build your.
Bryan (17:15-17:16): It's build a desk, build a top.
Bryan (17:16-17:18): But you have multiple things within that.
Andrew (17:20-17:21): Go ahead.
Bryan (17:25-17:32): So the problem we're having right now is I'll write all that out, put on a job card, and it's just saved now somewhere on the Internet.
Bryan (17:34-17:37): The PDFs are not saved with it because they're just snapshots.
Andrew (17:37-17:37): Correct.
Bryan (17:38-17:43): And none of that information translates to this and populated bill of materials.
Andrew (17:43-17:43): Which is.
Bryan (17:43-17:45): Which is the backbone.
Bryan (17:45-17:46): This is the backbone.
Andrew (17:46-17:46): Yeah.
Bryan (17:46-17:49): So that's why I have been doing it in this stage.
Bryan (17:49-17:50): I know I'm just.
Bryan (17:50-17:52): I'm doing a lot here because I'm doing all of it.
Andrew (17:52-17:52): But.
Bryan (17:54-17:57): This detailer to me is the person who does it.
Andrew (17:59-18:00): So let's continue.
Andrew (18:00-18:01): Let's say that we have.
Andrew (18:01-18:03): We've made all the job cards.
Andrew (18:03-18:15): So my logic applies here now because at the early design stages, we've allocated room location, cabinet, run cabinet, and we built all of that out.
Andrew (18:15-18:16): We can.
Andrew (18:16-18:16): Now.
Andrew (18:17-18:21): Now, when you create tasks, do you create tasks based on what level?
Andrew (18:23-18:25): And I'll rephrase that.
Andrew (18:25-18:25): Skill level.
Andrew (18:25-18:26): No.
Andrew (18:26-18:34): On what level do we assign to a project manager on the floor, say Levi, a cabinet run.
Andrew (18:36-18:39): Do you care or do you assign a cabinet?
Bryan (18:39-18:41): Right now I'm assigning cabinets.
Andrew (18:41-18:42): Okay, so.
Andrew (18:42-18:44): So how do you want to handle that?
Andrew (18:44-18:45): So it's.
Andrew (18:45-18:51): The best way to do it is go, here's the cabinet run, and here is the series of cabinets that you're doing.
Andrew (18:51-18:53): Here is the payment for it.
Andrew (18:53-18:58): And then how does Levi assign out cabinets?
Andrew (18:58-19:01): Or he has to handle the whole thing.
Andrew (19:02-19:05): How does he hand out sub cabinet tasks?
Bryan (19:06-19:09): I think those task cards, those other tasks could be there.
Bryan (19:09-19:11): For example, build a cabinet, build the crown.
Bryan (19:11-19:12): He could farm out the crown.
Andrew (19:12-19:13): Okay.
Bryan (19:14-19:15): And that's his responsibility.
Andrew (19:16-19:18): So in tasks.
Andrew (19:18-19:19): Cool.
Andrew (19:19-19:20): In task, you just put high.
Andrew (19:20-19:22): Just put hierarchy for me, just task.
Andrew (19:22-19:24): Under main task, put hierarchy.
Andrew (19:25-19:27): And I'll explain that to you in a second.
Andrew (19:29-19:29): Yep.
Andrew (19:29-19:32): Okay, so now we've got tasks.
Andrew (19:32-19:33): We've got hierarchy, we've got.
Andrew (19:33-19:34): Got that.
Andrew (19:37-19:39): The other part of getting the job out.
Andrew (19:39-19:41): Okay, now it's all built.
Andrew (19:41-19:46): Let's say I finished a cabinet, I have to update my task list.
Andrew (19:47-19:50): When I update my task list, it updates my project status.
Andrew (19:51-19:51): Right.
Andrew (19:52-19:54): So just like update tasks.
Andrew (19:59-20:00): And update project.
Andrew (20:05-20:06): Now here's a doozy.
Andrew (20:08-20:12): We shouldn't be having change orders at this phase.
Bryan (20:12-20:14): Yeah, but that's unrealistic.
Andrew (20:14-20:14): Right.
Andrew (20:14-20:15): So give me.
Andrew (20:16-20:19): Actually, no, let's finish and we'll come back and do change orders.
Bryan (20:19-20:24): Yeah, I actually think change orders are relatively easy because it's almost just a sub project.
Andrew (20:24-20:25): I just need to say it out loud.
Andrew (20:25-20:26): So like what's.
Andrew (20:26-20:26): What's next?
Andrew (20:26-20:31): After we've finished building all our cabinets and cabinet runs and things, we move it to where.
Bryan (20:33-20:41): So what we're currently doing is we have the notion build lading, where it has different statuses in production.
Bryan (20:42-20:46): In the paint booth QC'd in the trailer delivered.
Andrew (20:46-20:47): Okay.
Andrew (20:47-20:50): So I'm gonna put draw a line across the bottom like we did for receiving.
Andrew (20:51-20:52): Get out.
Andrew (20:52-20:52): Yep.
Andrew (20:52-20:53): And just call it warehouse management.
Andrew (21:02-21:08): And that means updating locations for deliverables.
Andrew (21:10-21:13): So that person needs to be able to manage the factory.
Andrew (21:14-21:16): We know where everything is right now.
Andrew (21:16-21:18): Job A is existing here.
Andrew (21:18-21:19): Job B is existing here.
Andrew (21:19-21:22): Their job is to maintain the positioning.
Andrew (21:23-21:24): Hey, I don't know what this is.
Andrew (21:24-21:25): Why is it in this vein?
Andrew (21:25-21:25): Yeah.
Andrew (21:25-21:27): Okay, so what do they do?
Andrew (21:27-21:30): Just to just outline for me, the warehouse management.
Bryan (21:32-21:35): They would do QC work and they would do.
Bryan (21:42-21:43): Loading of the trailer.
Andrew (21:44-21:45): Okay.
Andrew (21:51-21:52): What else are they doing?
Andrew (21:52-21:58): That person also needs their dailies are to check everything is in its right place and nothing is not in this place.
Andrew (21:59-22:01): Because that I'm looking out there now at our base, and it's crazy.
Bryan (22:02-22:04): Well, the job is bigger than the bay.
Andrew (22:04-22:04): Huh?
Bryan (22:04-22:06): The job's bigger than the bay.
Andrew (22:06-22:06): Yeah.
Andrew (22:06-22:08): So we gotta work that out.
Andrew (22:08-22:10): The walls have to be movable.
Andrew (22:10-22:11): Yeah.
Andrew (22:13-22:15): Okay, so what else is warehouse management doing?
Andrew (22:15-22:17): Is this the same person that's doing inventory?
Bryan (22:18-22:19): Probably.
Andrew (22:19-22:22): So that's one we can see a job shaping right now.
Andrew (22:22-22:24): Okay, what else, what else?
Andrew (22:24-22:28): After a job is done here, the.
Bryan (22:28-22:31): Big things are qc, tracking all the parts, loading it.
Andrew (22:32-22:33): Okay.
Andrew (22:33-22:33): And then.
Andrew (22:34-22:39): Okay, so to go out of production, what do we have to have a QC report.
Bryan (22:43-22:45): For us when it leaves production?
Bryan (22:45-22:46): It goes to the paint booth.
Andrew (22:47-22:48): Okay, cool.
Andrew (22:48-22:50): So that's not out of production then.
Andrew (22:50-22:52): So we have to move it to the paint booth.
Andrew (22:53-22:56): So how do we do that?
Andrew (22:56-22:58): Because warehouse management QC is.
Andrew (22:58-22:59): Oh, that's right.
Andrew (22:59-23:01): Just put another line and just go finishing.
Andrew (23:07-23:09): So it's somebody's job to transition things between zones.
Andrew (23:11-23:19): I would say that it's this person's job too, to get the resources ready for pre production.
Andrew (23:21-23:32): So, like, if they know that today we're starting a new job, they've already done the count and confirmed it for Levi before Levi has to do it, because they should have done that before knowing that it's coming.
Andrew (23:32-23:34): And so we don't have a block in the pipe.
Andrew (23:36-23:36): So.
Andrew (23:37-23:39): Yeah, so that's their job already too.
Andrew (23:40-23:41): So basically that job is.
Andrew (23:41-23:45): Is loading for each of the stages and loading out.
Andrew (23:46-23:48): So Levi shouldn't have to Go pick his sheets.
Andrew (23:48-23:53): Or he should already have a preset marker of hey, this is your bet.
Andrew (23:53-23:54): This is the sheets for you.
Andrew (23:54-23:56): And put a piece of paper in there.
Andrew (23:56-24:00): Those top three are yours or it's already moved to a zone.
Bryan (24:00-24:05): Maybe that because it won't work for pre finished and they don't pick sheets.
Bryan (24:05-24:06): It gets cut in the cnc.
Andrew (24:06-24:07): Correct.
Andrew (24:07-24:11): So which means that they should be prepping for the CNC person too.
Andrew (24:11-24:14): The CNC person just has to read the label and go.
Andrew (24:14-24:15): This is the file name.
Andrew (24:16-24:17): These are the three sheets for it.
Andrew (24:17-24:18): Yeah.
Bryan (24:19-24:20): So the sorting.
Bryan (24:21-24:24): The real world problem we have right now is lots of parts coming out from doing.
Andrew (24:24-24:26): We missed CNC cut list.
Bryan (24:26-24:27): It's right here.
Andrew (24:27-24:29): That's just the files to put.
Andrew (24:29-24:30): Cut list there too.
Andrew (24:30-24:31): It's the same thing.
Andrew (24:32-24:36): It's not because the cut list has details about the job.
Andrew (24:36-24:38): How many pieces they should have at the end.
Andrew (24:38-24:39): How many?
Andrew (24:39-24:40): Like the same thing.
Bryan (24:40-24:44): It's like the job summary of the NC files with it has a picture of the sheet and everything.
Andrew (24:44-24:44): Oh, labeling.
Andrew (24:45-24:47): Okay, cool.
Andrew (24:48-24:48): So finishing.
Andrew (24:48-24:50): Talk me through that process.
Andrew (24:50-24:51): So he needs.
Andrew (24:52-24:55): He needs a check in for like what is.
Andrew (24:55-24:56): What am I finishing?
Bryan (24:56-24:58): Quantity of parts and what he has to do.
Andrew (24:58-24:58): Cool.
Andrew (24:58-25:00): So put that on there.
Andrew (25:00-25:03): And then we need to make sure he has the supplies too.
Andrew (25:04-25:05): Are we handling that?
Andrew (25:05-25:06): Was he handling that?
Bryan (25:06-25:07): I think we should take on as.
Andrew (25:07-25:08): Much as we can because that is.
Andrew (25:08-25:10): That is a pipeline breaker.
Andrew (25:10-25:11): If he handling it.
Andrew (25:13-25:14): You know what I mean?
Andrew (25:15-25:19): Because in here his, you know, like life is crazy.
Andrew (25:19-25:21): He might just forget to order the thing.
Andrew (25:22-25:27): So that means that supplies plus units have to be ready and in the bay.
Andrew (25:28-25:29): Cool.
Andrew (25:30-25:33): He finishes QC continues.
Andrew (25:33-25:35): So second level of qc.
Andrew (25:40-25:41): And now what?
Bryan (25:45-25:46): Yeah, it's done now.
Bryan (25:46-25:47): So now it's time for delivery.
Andrew (25:48-25:48): So what is.
Andrew (25:48-25:49): What do we need for delivery to.
Bryan (25:49-25:54): Leave successfully, we need to track each part that goes into the trailer.
Andrew (25:54-25:55): Okay.
Bryan (25:56-25:59): And then we need to make a bol.
Andrew (25:59-25:59): Yeah.
Andrew (25:59-26:01): So we're supposed to drive on that.
Bryan (26:01-26:08): So track all parts, all pieces.
Bryan (26:15-26:16): And a driver.
Andrew (26:24-26:28): Okay, cool.
Andrew (26:28-26:31): How do we order all those things and pay for it?
Bryan (26:32-26:35): How do we order a driver?
Andrew (26:35-26:37): Yeah, so like bol driver.
Bryan (26:40-26:41): That's what I was saying here.
Bryan (26:41-26:47): This auto populated bol is directly connected to the task cards is directly connected to the detailer.
Andrew (26:47-26:50): So there are delivery tasks that need to be made.
Andrew (26:50-26:51): A delivery.
Andrew (26:51-26:52): Oh, you've already got that at the top.
Andrew (26:52-26:53): No, that's correct.
Andrew (26:53-26:56): So put delivery tasks which means book the boat.
Andrew (26:56-26:57): Book the.
Bryan (26:57-26:58): Don't have to do it.
Andrew (26:58-26:58): Anymore.
Andrew (26:58-26:58): Huh?
Bryan (26:58-26:59): Don't have to do it.
Andrew (26:59-27:00): No more boats.
Andrew (27:00-27:01): What do you mean no more boats?
Bryan (27:01-27:02): I just go to Cape Cod Express.
Bryan (27:02-27:03): No more boats.
Bryan (27:03-27:04): So much easier.
Andrew (27:05-27:06): Oh, okay.
Andrew (27:06-27:10): It's just the company we use now, so we just have to drive to the Cape and dump it there.
Bryan (27:10-27:11): Okay, cool.
Bryan (27:11-27:12): Way better.
Andrew (27:12-27:14): So let's go to the next part.
Andrew (27:14-27:14): Install.
Bryan (27:15-27:17): So that would be us here.
Andrew (27:17-27:19): So let's say it's Chase.
Andrew (27:19-27:20): What does Chase need?
Bryan (27:22-27:23): He needs drawings.
Andrew (27:23-27:24): Yeah.
Bryan (27:27-27:40): PDF, Hardware, Site access.
Andrew (27:49-27:52): Okay, so take a step back, look at the bullet.
Andrew (27:52-27:53): What are we missing?
Andrew (27:53-27:55): Just run through it logically.
Bryan (27:57-28:14): One of the things I feel that we're missing right now is like the project summary startup, which would be like making the folder or making the job page or whatever it is to look at to where everything goes to.
Andrew (28:14-28:14): huh.
Bryan (28:15-28:17): I don't think that's mapped out.
Bryan (28:17-28:25): That's something like literally just duplicating the folder, putting the name, making a job number is a weird pinch point right now.
Andrew (28:25-28:28): Okay, so cool.
Andrew (28:28-28:29): That's a fair point.
Bryan (28:29-28:29): Yeah.
Andrew (28:31-28:33): But if you had to do this completely on paper.
Andrew (28:33-28:37): Let's just erase any kind of system that we have right now.
Andrew (28:37-28:41): Let's talk about the ins and outs to make this work.
Andrew (28:41-28:43): Let's say they're all completely independent.
Andrew (28:44-28:49): Let's go through each process to see like what we need.
Andrew (28:49-28:57): And like if you had to, if the computer shut down, what are the things that are missing that we're not passing on to the next section right now?
Bryan (28:58-29:01): So discovery is simple.
Bryan (29:01-29:07): We get an inquiry.
Bryan (29:12-29:13): And then there's some sort of.
Andrew (29:13-29:15): Have you got another color marker?
Bryan (29:16-29:18): No, I don't even know where this one came from.
Andrew (29:24-29:30): Because I just want to tick off what's like in like use different colors and where we're at.
Andrew (29:30-29:30): Right?
Andrew (29:30-29:31): Yeah.
Andrew (29:32-29:33): And you got an eraser and everything.
Andrew (29:35-29:35): Thank you.
Andrew (29:35-29:50): Part of you who would like dummy, Don't use the green one.
Andrew (29:50-29:51): Why?
Andrew (29:51-29:54): The green one's for marking where we're at on things.
Andrew (29:55-29:59): I said grab it so you could like tick off what you have and don't have this dude.
Andrew (30:00-30:00): It was like why?
Andrew (30:00-30:03): So can visually work out like where it can focus on.
Bryan (30:08-30:10): So an inquiry comes in some form of meeting with a client.
Bryan (30:11-30:16): I'm going to get inspiration, picks, drawings, dimensions, whatever at that juncture or I'm going to go to the field and get them.
Andrew (30:17-30:17): Okay.
Andrew (30:17-30:19): So use the green and the red.
Andrew (30:20-30:23): What we have a storage place for and what we don't have.
Bryan (30:25-30:26): Use the green and the red.
Andrew (30:26-30:27): Yeah.
Andrew (30:27-30:27): So green for.
Andrew (30:27-30:29): We have it red.
Bryan (30:29-30:30): We don't green for.
Bryan (30:30-30:31): We have it.
Andrew (30:31-30:33): So where we put Inspo pics right now.
Andrew (30:34-30:35): We have it where?
Andrew (30:36-30:38): In the folder.
Andrew (30:38-30:38): Great.
Andrew (30:39-30:40): Just use pics, it's fine.
Andrew (30:41-30:42): Where do we track money right now?
Bryan (30:45-30:47): I guess bank statements.
Andrew (30:47-30:48): We don't have a.
Andrew (30:48-30:48): That's a.
Andrew (30:48-30:50): No, we have no money.
Andrew (30:51-30:51): Confirming.
Andrew (30:51-30:52): Moving along the pipe.
Bryan (30:53-30:55): I get proposals made by you.
Andrew (30:55-30:55): I don't save them.
Andrew (30:57-30:57): Okay.
Andrew (30:57-30:59): They should be put in the folder structure.
Bryan (31:00-31:03): Right now they're text discovery and then I just send it to the client.
Andrew (31:04-31:04): Yeah.
Andrew (31:04-31:08): So when I text them to you should be putting them in the project folder.
Bryan (31:08-31:09): I feel like you have access to the folder.
Bryan (31:09-31:10): You could put them there.
Andrew (31:12-31:12): Yeah.
Andrew (31:13-31:14): Not my job, though.
Bryan (31:15-31:17): Initial and file out.
Andrew (31:17-31:18): Okay, so they need to go in the folders.
Andrew (31:18-31:22): Is there proposals and invoicing in the folder structure right now?
Andrew (31:22-31:23): There is.
Andrew (31:23-31:24): I'm pretty sure there is.
Bryan (31:24-31:25): There is, but it's under sales.
Bryan (31:26-31:28): So it's going to come to the question.
Bryan (31:28-31:30): That's public access right now.
Andrew (31:31-31:35): So you need a separate, non public access.
Andrew (31:36-31:36): Yeah.
Andrew (31:36-31:37): Cool.
Andrew (31:37-31:37): So just.
Andrew (31:37-31:38): I would put that as a.
Andrew (31:39-31:44): Just use the red and just write public for that.
Andrew (31:48-31:48): Okay.
Andrew (31:49-31:51): Job summary inspects.
Andrew (31:51-31:55): We're not outputting that right now, so we need to do that.
Andrew (31:55-31:56): Let's just put a question mark.
Andrew (31:56-31:57): Yeah, just do that.
Andrew (31:57-31:58): Yeah, Great.
Andrew (31:58-31:59): Cool.
Andrew (32:00-32:04): So without that, we're already handicapping design.
Andrew (32:06-32:06): Okay.
Andrew (32:06-32:15): So we didn't talk about the other one now where we're coming in with architectural things, which means that job is not handicapped because that has everything.
Andrew (32:16-32:17): So.
Andrew (32:17-32:19): Okay, so up there, what's at the top there?
Andrew (32:20-32:21): Field dimensions.
Andrew (32:21-32:22): Okay.
Andrew (32:22-32:24): So we need a standardized way to do the job spec.
Andrew (32:26-32:27): Okay.
Andrew (32:27-32:29): So rhino DWGs.
Bryan (32:29-32:30): So this is all job spec.
Andrew (32:30-32:31): Yeah.
Andrew (32:35-32:36): Okay.
Andrew (32:37-32:41): This next part is here, detailing.
Andrew (32:41-32:42): And so we need a.
Andrew (32:43-32:46): We need to build out the job specification card.
Bryan (32:47-32:49): I think Aiden could be my detailer long term.
Andrew (32:50-32:50): I think he'd be good at it.
Andrew (32:50-32:52): Yeah, I do too.
Bryan (32:57-32:59): So define this job.
Andrew (33:01-33:06): I can see the breakdown is coming out of the line clearly right now.
Andrew (33:09-33:12): So the output we're missing is outputting the job card.
Andrew (33:12-33:12): And bom.
Bryan (33:13-33:14): This is going to be dagger.
Andrew (33:14-33:18): Yeah, Job card.
Andrew (33:18-33:20): And BOM is missing.
Andrew (33:20-33:20): Not job card.
Andrew (33:20-33:22): The job specification card.
Andrew (33:24-33:25): Yeah, but that's.
Andrew (33:25-33:27): That's the start job specification.
Andrew (33:28-33:29): And then that's the finishing.
Bryan (33:30-33:34): There was one time when you showed me, I think it was actually a notion page where it was like a cover page for what?
Bryan (33:35-33:37): And then that's what I envisioned.
Andrew (33:37-33:38): I would call it a job Bible.
Andrew (33:39-33:40): Job Bible.
Andrew (33:45-33:52): And then expand Job Bible with the Detail information and then adding in all those files to it.
Andrew (33:56-33:56): Cool.
Andrew (33:57-34:00): And then in sourcing the same thing, they get the bom.
Andrew (34:00-34:02): We don't have a bom right now.
Andrew (34:02-34:03): So that's a section.
Andrew (34:04-34:05): Oh, yeah, we do.
Andrew (34:05-34:05): But, like.
Andrew (34:05-34:06): Yeah, we don't have, like.
Andrew (34:06-34:08): We've only just started implementing a bomb.
Bryan (34:08-34:08): Yeah.
Bryan (34:08-34:09): And it needs.
Andrew (34:09-34:10): It needs work.
Bryan (34:10-34:10): It needs work.
Andrew (34:13-34:13): Okay.
Andrew (34:13-34:17): We don't have a master inventory management yet.
Bryan (34:17-34:18): Current inventory.
Andrew (34:22-34:24): The thing is, we started a manual way of doing it.
Andrew (34:24-34:26): It's getting your staff to do it.
Andrew (34:31-34:33): Everyone's getting pulled to side jobs all the time.
Bryan (34:34-34:36): So it's not a problem that's going away.
Andrew (34:37-34:39): True, but we have to.
Andrew (34:39-34:41): If we don't, I can't solve it.
Andrew (34:41-34:42): If we don't have the resources.
Bryan (34:43-34:43): So this is.
Bryan (34:43-34:44): This.
Bryan (34:48-34:49): Two to four hours a week.
Andrew (34:49-34:51): Sadie's not coming in and counting stock.
Andrew (34:51-34:52): She can.
Andrew (34:53-34:53): Okay.
Andrew (34:53-34:54): She wants it.
Bryan (34:54-34:55): She doesn't want to.
Bryan (34:55-34:56): She wants to do secretarial stuff.
Andrew (34:56-34:57): Okay.
Bryan (34:57-34:59): But we have.
Bryan (34:59-34:59): I need.
Bryan (34:59-35:02): She wants to, like, come in and interview for a job next week.
Bryan (35:03-35:06): Like, really try to be professional and figure out something.
Andrew (35:06-35:07): So Sadie's job is.
Andrew (35:07-35:08): She's gonna do it.
Andrew (35:08-35:09): She's.
Andrew (35:09-35:10): She is perfect.
Andrew (35:10-35:11): You know why?
Andrew (35:11-35:12): She can look at money.
Bryan (35:13-35:14): Yeah, definitely.
Andrew (35:14-35:14): We don't.
Andrew (35:14-35:17): Like, as in we don't care that Sadie knows how much a job is.
Andrew (35:17-35:18): It doesn't matter to us.
Bryan (35:18-35:19): Right.
Andrew (35:19-35:21): So Sadie's that person.
Andrew (35:21-35:23): That means Sadie's the inventory person.
Andrew (35:23-35:25): Yeah, Sadie will make purchase orders.
Andrew (35:25-35:27): Yeah, Sadie will make.
Andrew (35:28-35:30): Okay, cool.
Andrew (35:30-35:31): So I would split.
Andrew (35:31-35:34): So here are the jobs I'm seeing just right on the side there.
Andrew (35:34-35:37): Aiden's job is detailer and warehouse management.
Andrew (35:42-35:43): Yeah, that's Hayden.
Andrew (35:44-35:50): So he moves things from zone to zone, and he checks that all of that's fine.
Andrew (35:51-36:00): The inventory management, and he reports back to Sadie on inventory needed requirements.
Andrew (36:07-36:09): You don't have a project manager.
Andrew (36:09-36:12): I would say Sadie, but if she's only doing two or four hours, it's not enough.
Bryan (36:12-36:13): It's too much for her.
Andrew (36:13-36:14): It's not.
Andrew (36:14-36:20): So you need someone to know where projects are at and all the bottlenecks and moving them along.
Andrew (36:20-36:21): Who's doing that?
Andrew (36:22-36:23): Okay, so that's you.
Andrew (36:26-36:31): So as the warehouse and detailer, he would make sure that, like.
Andrew (36:32-36:35): So he's also setting up people for jobs.
Bryan (36:36-36:38): He's gonna, like, give them the cards.
Andrew (36:38-36:38): Not yet.
Andrew (36:38-36:40): He's gonna give them the cards.
Andrew (36:40-36:41): But he's.
Andrew (36:41-36:43): No, you have to give them the cards because you have to talk about project.
Andrew (36:43-36:44): But he.
Andrew (36:44-36:47): He's one of those people who Will prep them for their project.
Andrew (36:48-36:49): Like he'll go and get.
Andrew (36:49-36:50): He'll make sure there's enough.
Andrew (36:51-36:56): He'll make sure that the sheets have been allocated and the labels on the sheet and he knows exactly where it is.
Andrew (36:56-37:01): He's going to be the point of call where someone's going to go like, hey, do you know where the sheets are for this new project I'm starting?
Andrew (37:01-37:03): Yeah, they're in bayou blue blah.
Andrew (37:04-37:08): And then he's also responsible for managing the order of the base.
Andrew (37:08-37:13): So keeping everything neat and tidy and then moving things from finishing and out of finishing.
Andrew (37:13-37:15): Which means he's also qc.
Andrew (37:15-37:17): You have to train him to qc.
Andrew (37:19-37:24): And then we need a QC checklist for what quality control looks like.
Andrew (37:24-37:25): What is he looking for?
Andrew (37:25-37:25): So the.
Andrew (37:25-37:27): That's what you actually have to train him on.
Andrew (37:27-37:28): That's actually really smart.
Andrew (37:29-37:32): Okay, so put QC under Aiden too.
Andrew (37:39-37:40): Does that make sense?
Andrew (37:40-37:41): That makes a lot of sense to me.
Andrew (37:41-37:42): Like, I think so.
Bryan (37:42-37:43): Yeah.
Andrew (37:43-37:43): Yeah.
Andrew (37:43-37:44): Okay, cool.
Andrew (37:45-37:47): Let's go down the sourcing.
Andrew (37:48-37:49): So Sadie's gonna order.
Bryan (37:50-37:51): She can, yeah.
Andrew (37:51-37:53): Which means she needs the purchase.
Andrew (37:53-37:55): So Sadie receives purchase orders.
Andrew (37:56-38:01): That means that Aiden has to check the bill of materials and then.
Andrew (38:01-38:02): Okay, I've got it down.
Andrew (38:03-38:04): Aiden is a project.
Andrew (38:05-38:07): Aiden says I have very similar jobs.
Andrew (38:07-38:10): Sadie manages it globally.
Andrew (38:10-38:12): Aiden manages it project based.
Andrew (38:13-38:14): So what does that mean?
Andrew (38:14-38:15): So a couple things.
Andrew (38:15-38:19): One is Aiden will alec check if the resources we.
Andrew (38:19-38:21): We have the resources to complete a project.
Andrew (38:21-38:24): And he'll request things to be purchased.
Andrew (38:24-38:27): Say you receive purchase orders so he can track inventory.
Andrew (38:28-38:30): Yes, he can track inventory.
Andrew (38:30-38:33): And then he comes back to say you with purchase order requests.
Andrew (38:35-38:40): It's A, E, D A N A, E, D A N, A, E, D.
Bryan (38:40-38:42): A N. What the heck?
Andrew (38:47-38:48): That's great.
Andrew (38:48-38:49): That's a good role.
Andrew (38:49-38:50): Easy role.
Andrew (38:52-38:54): Okay, so then Sadie approves.
Andrew (38:54-38:55): Okay.
Andrew (38:55-38:58): Now with purchase orders, is Sadie approving or she checking with you?
Andrew (39:00-39:02): She's the one that comes to you with all the purchase orders.
Bryan (39:02-39:03): I'm not your approval.
Andrew (39:03-39:03): Okay, cool.
Andrew (39:03-39:08): So she needs a way to have show all the projects and all the purchase and then just get.
Andrew (39:08-39:13): She needs to have a scheduled meeting with you to approve and then she goes and has the way to complete it.
Andrew (39:14-39:15): Great, cool.
Andrew (39:15-39:16): What else is there?
Andrew (39:16-39:18): And now receiving comes in.
Andrew (39:19-39:20): Sadie's not going to go count it.
Andrew (39:20-39:21): She's a pregnant woman.
Andrew (39:21-39:22): So like receiving comes in.
Andrew (39:22-39:24): Aiden's going to warehouse manage that.
Bryan (39:28-39:33): If it's hardware, he'll have his job base and he'll have something each piece of hardware that comes.
Bryan (39:33-39:35): And now it's a tagged PO for job.
Bryan (39:36-39:42): And if it's sheet goods, the same thing apart from bulk.
Andrew (39:42-39:42): Okay.
Andrew (39:42-39:54): So I feel like we need some sort of like even a piece of plastic or acrylic that just is like rideable or whatever that we can just slide under a stack of sheets so that you know, like these top four.
Bryan (39:55-39:57): So you just know they'll be vertical.
Andrew (39:57-39:58): Okay, cool.
Bryan (39:58-39:58): In the racks.
Andrew (39:58-40:00): But it just needs to be something that we can keep with it.
Andrew (40:00-40:03): So it's of kind clear that it's a bundle.
Andrew (40:04-40:07): Just so it needs to be quick and visual.
Andrew (40:07-40:08): G', day, Shane.
Bryan (40:08-40:12): You know, and my backup is which I would prefer because things move around.
Bryan (40:12-40:14): Is a sticker on the left written on.
Andrew (40:14-40:15): Yeah, I.
Andrew (40:15-40:17): That I just want to make sure.
Bryan (40:17-40:17): I'm getting this right.
Andrew (40:17-40:18): Yep.
Bryan (40:18-40:20): I don't see three, four on here.
Bryan (40:21-40:22): No, it's not the.
Bryan (40:22-40:24): The last one that I uploaded at the end of the day.
Bryan (40:24-40:24): It's.
Bryan (40:24-40:25): It's on the machine.
Andrew (40:25-40:26): What it top and bottom.
Andrew (40:27-40:28): Oh, it is on.
Andrew (40:28-40:28): Yeah.
Bryan (40:28-40:29): It's under gardener folder.
Bryan (40:29-40:30): But I never put on this.
Andrew (40:30-40:32): Okay, cool.
Bryan (40:32-40:34): Do you need the picture?
Andrew (40:34-40:35): So it is double sided.
Andrew (40:35-40:37): How is it mating up to the three?
Bryan (40:37-40:39): How is it mating up to the other one inch?
Andrew (40:39-40:40): Because they're together.
Andrew (40:40-40:41): Right.
Bryan (40:41-40:43): It's double sided because of a different piece on there.
Bryan (40:43-40:45): There's multiple pieces on the three quarter.
Bryan (40:45-40:48): The one for the door that Shaggy's doing is not double sided.
Bryan (40:48-40:49): That piece in particular.
Andrew (40:49-40:50): Oh, it's just.
Bryan (40:51-40:51): Yeah.
Andrew (40:53-40:53): Okay, cool.
Bryan (40:54-40:55): I'll send you a reference photo.
Andrew (40:56-40:56): Thank you.
Andrew (41:35-41:35): Does this.
Andrew (41:35-41:39): Does this feel like it's making sense on the board right now?
Andrew (41:39-41:39): I think so.
Andrew (41:39-41:40): Yeah.
Andrew (42:03-42:03): Okay.
Bryan (42:07-42:10): So yeah, so the sheets will come in one way or another.
Bryan (42:12-42:15): Bulk things need no label.
Bryan (42:15-42:17): Aiden will learn that eventually.
Bryan (42:17-42:19): Pre finished plywood is a bulk item.
Bryan (42:19-42:20): Needs no label.
Bryan (42:21-42:22): Things that are allocated.
Andrew (42:22-42:26): He needs to keep an inventory of like we have 20 sheets.
Andrew (42:27-42:27): He does.
Andrew (42:27-42:28): I come in today.
Andrew (42:28-42:29): Yeah.
Andrew (42:29-42:30): We're on this project.
Bryan (42:31-42:33): I don't care if he marks on the side like.
Bryan (42:33-42:34): So he can keep track of where it's at.
Andrew (42:36-42:36): Yeah.
Bryan (42:36-42:38): Or he can write on the side of the sheet.
Bryan (42:38-42:39): Same thing.
Bryan (42:39-42:41): And then he can know how many we have left.
Andrew (42:41-42:42): Okay.
Bryan (42:43-42:47): But I guess that's the only one.
Bryan (42:47-42:47): Everything else.
Andrew (42:47-42:49): So I'm gonna pause right here.
Andrew (42:49-42:51): Just from Aiden's head right now.
Andrew (42:51-42:53): What does my week look like?
Bryan (42:55-42:56): Sadie wants to do the ordering on.
Andrew (42:57-42:57): Monday.
Bryan (42:59-43:03): Which she all things then could be set up for a Wednesday delivery.
Bryan (43:04-43:10): So if he's working two days a week on a Monday Wednesday, he could Be in for the delivery day.
Bryan (43:11-43:14): Delivery would come by noon Labor Day.
Andrew (43:14-43:17): I'm also okay with him being, you know, doing a Friday solo.
Bryan (43:18-43:19): Yeah, probably.
Andrew (43:19-43:20): That's actually probably better.
Andrew (43:20-43:21): No one's on the floor.
Andrew (43:22-43:22): He cleans.
Andrew (43:22-43:25): He puts everything in and correct my office.
Bryan (43:25-43:25): Yeah.
Andrew (43:27-43:28): You're asking a lot.
Andrew (43:28-43:29): Oh, yeah.
Andrew (43:29-43:31): Clean is like the secondary task.
Andrew (43:32-43:37): Like, because he has to make sure that we're ready for a reset of the week.
Andrew (43:37-43:38): Yeah.
Andrew (43:38-43:40): I don't think he's full.
Andrew (43:41-43:41): I think he's full.
Andrew (43:42-43:46): I don't think you realize how much I've instituted.
Andrew (43:46-43:49): I think initially when he's starting, he's going to be more full than you think.
Andrew (43:50-43:56): And then it'll ease up once the situation like current inventory, like thoroughly going through.
Andrew (43:59-44:03): Yeah, like the first step would be to identify all the inventory we have.
Andrew (44:03-44:12): The next step is to start to work out expiry dates on things based on jobs, based on linear feet based on blah, blah.
Andrew (44:12-44:13): So like drill bits.
Andrew (44:13-44:14): We have them.
Andrew (44:14-44:15): Yes, I can say that we have them.
Andrew (44:15-44:20): But now it's going to sit with you and go like, hey, how.
Andrew (44:20-44:22): How much do we know that this runs out by.
Andrew (44:23-44:27): And then like inventory map is a full.
Andrew (44:27-44:28): It's going to be full time.
Andrew (44:28-44:29): That's a lot.
Andrew (44:30-44:34): And then like on a single job, it'll be quick because he'll set up a new job.
Andrew (44:34-44:38): But then as much as these guys are working on a new cabinet, he has to know.
Bryan (44:38-44:42): So it would be good if he worked on Friday because he could send something out for Sadie on Monday.
Andrew (44:42-44:43): I might make correct.
Andrew (44:45-44:47): He's definitely a Friday when no one's here.
Andrew (44:47-44:48): It's great.
Bryan (44:48-44:49): It is.
Bryan (44:49-44:50): It's nice.
Bryan (44:50-44:50): Quiet.
Andrew (44:50-44:51): Yeah, it's quiet.
Andrew (44:51-44:53): Doesn't have to like deal with anyone.
Andrew (44:53-44:54): Doesn't have to deal with chaos.
Andrew (44:54-44:56): No one's currently using things.
Andrew (44:56-45:00): He'll come in, check where the job statuses are.
Andrew (45:00-45:01): So that's okay.
Andrew (45:01-45:02): I'm talking out loud now.
Andrew (45:02-45:09): He would come in, see what jobs we have for the coming week, and then what does he do?
Andrew (45:10-45:11): What does he see?
Andrew (45:11-45:11): What does he.
Bryan (45:14-45:16): It would be nice for the CNC guy on Monday to just walk in.
Andrew (45:16-45:18): And have the sheets ready to go correct.
Bryan (45:19-45:22): It would be nice, but it's pretty much just pre finished.
Bryan (45:25-45:26): No, that's not true.
Bryan (45:26-45:28): It would be good at least to know that the sheets are ready, that.
Andrew (45:28-45:29): They'Re on the floor.
Bryan (45:30-45:35): Because if he's there on a Friday and it's not there, we can put an emergent delay delivery for Monday.
Andrew (45:37-45:41): So is he loading the USB Stick from the.
Andrew (45:41-45:46): From the collected folder and putting that there by the station.
Bryan (45:48-45:49): I don't think so.
Bryan (45:51-45:52): I don't think so.
Andrew (45:54-45:54): Is he.
Andrew (45:54-45:55): So is he putting the sheet.
Andrew (45:56-45:57): Good.
Bryan (45:57-46:02): And the reason I'm saying that is because Dagger who's been the operator, I'm not going to get give him the making of the NC file.
Bryan (46:02-46:05): So he is the connective tissue there for both of it.
Andrew (46:05-46:06): Correct.
Andrew (46:07-46:13): So Dagger when he finishes drawing should load onto so on the stick should have two folders.
Andrew (46:15-46:21): It should have completed and not completed like to be done or in production.
Andrew (46:21-46:30): And in pre production you should have a pre production folder and a production folder because that production folder should be ready to go.
Andrew (46:30-46:32): So we're not wasting time.
Andrew (46:35-46:38): So how many jobs are you drawing on a regular basis?
Bryan (46:38-46:39): We have like three active right now.
Andrew (46:39-46:43): Okay so how many is there an entire day of drawing?
Andrew (46:44-46:46): Is there a morning of drawing?
Andrew (46:46-46:48): An afternoon of cutting for Dagger.
Andrew (46:48-46:49): How do you want to do it?
Bryan (46:49-46:51): I don't want CNC ever to stop.
Bryan (46:51-46:55): He will be able to work on right now his gaps are when the machine's running.
Bryan (46:55-46:56): What does he do?
Andrew (46:57-46:58): So you want him to draw while that's happening.
Andrew (46:58-47:04): Yeah, but he's doing that from the floor or he's doing that from here.
Bryan (47:04-47:05): He can do it from the floor.
Bryan (47:06-47:07): I do it all the time.
Bryan (47:07-47:08): It's pretty easy.
Andrew (47:08-47:09): Okay, cool.
Bryan (47:09-47:10): Especially with templates.
Bryan (47:10-47:10): Much better.
Andrew (47:10-47:11): Okay.
Andrew (47:12-47:16): Long term wise that needs to be ergonomically mapped.
Andrew (47:16-47:17): He needs a station.
Andrew (47:18-47:18): Not just that.
Bryan (47:18-47:19): That's okay.
Andrew (47:19-47:26): Like, like generally I'm just saying like it's just going to be chaos and chaotic environment, chaotic product.
Andrew (47:27-47:31): Just letting you know heads up right now that's going to happen even though we're not considering.
Andrew (47:31-47:32): I'm just telling you.
Andrew (47:32-47:40): So if he's doing that we need to know what's been drawn and what's not been drawn and what's coming in the next week.
Andrew (47:41-47:43): So who's the where is the pond of master in all this?
Bryan (47:43-47:45): Convert sleeve behind that.
Bryan (47:45-47:47): He needs to know what DWG files are even ready for him.
Andrew (47:48-47:49): Right.
Bryan (47:51-47:57): So somewhere in this project Bible active timeline checklist.
Andrew (47:57-47:59): So this is a per job level.
Andrew (48:00-48:04): We now need to talk globally because that's a global task.
Andrew (48:04-48:06): There is a DWD to be joined.
Andrew (48:07-48:08): So this is the view.
Bryan (48:08-48:09): Why isn't it a job task?
Andrew (48:11-48:14): Because there may be multiple projects and multiple DWGs that need to be drawn.
Bryan (48:14-48:16): And he just has to go into the job to find.
Andrew (48:16-48:21): Yeah, you kind of want to switch someone's brain off and Only focus on the task.
Andrew (48:22-48:27): Technically, the drawer should just log in and not know anything about anything he needs to draw.
Andrew (48:28-48:28): It's like a real.
Bryan (48:28-48:30): Talking about this program.
Andrew (48:30-48:31): Yes.
Bryan (48:31-48:32): Not.
Bryan (48:32-48:34): Not the draftsman and not the detail.
Bryan (48:34-48:34): You're talking about the program.
Andrew (48:35-48:36): That programmer.
Andrew (48:36-48:39): We need to equip that person to be a robot.
Andrew (48:39-48:39): Yeah.
Andrew (48:40-48:41): They don't care what anything is.
Andrew (48:41-48:43): They're looking at one thing.
Andrew (48:43-48:45): They're copying it to the format that needs to be copied to.
Bryan (48:45-48:47): You're saying that's what it is right now?
Andrew (48:47-48:47): Yeah.
Andrew (48:48-48:48): So.
Andrew (48:49-48:54): So that means that like he can be drawing for other things while that CNC is going.
Andrew (48:55-48:55): Yeah.
Bryan (48:55-48:58): That's where I feel like that's what I just trained him to do.
Andrew (48:58-48:59): Correct.
Andrew (49:00-49:03): So what I'm saying is that's not project related.
Andrew (49:03-49:04): That's just.
Andrew (49:04-49:08): It's just a global checking off of tasks.
Bryan (49:08-49:08): Okay.
Andrew (49:09-49:10): Okay.
Andrew (49:11-49:11): All right.
Andrew (49:14-49:15): Pull up a check.
Andrew (49:25-49:30): Okay, so this is my current project page.
Andrew (49:30-49:31): Okay.
Andrew (49:31-49:39): I am going to work on improving a few things, but it has for your eyes some basic information about it.
Andrew (49:39-49:40): Okay.
Andrew (49:40-49:45): There are project alerts if things come up and I'm going to explain a couple things to you in a second.
Andrew (49:45-49:49): In here there are pages of each of the pages.
Andrew (49:49-49:55): And this is the broom that we're working on right now.
Andrew (49:55-49:56): That's down here.
Andrew (49:56-49:59): I have broken it into its structure.
Andrew (49:59-50:00): Here is a room.
Andrew (50:01-50:02): Here is a room location.
Andrew (50:02-50:03): Here is a cabinet run.
Andrew (50:03-50:05): And here is a cabinet specification.
Andrew (50:06-50:11): So you can look at each of these boxes in whichever way that you want and you can see what we have.
Andrew (50:11-50:16): I have K1 is the room kitchen one type floor.
Andrew (50:16-50:20): Now here's where I'm going to like ask things.
Andrew (50:30-50:34): What do we need to know about a room that I'm missing?
Bryan (50:38-50:41): We need to know everything we're going to manufacture.
Andrew (50:42-50:45): Okay, but tell me more about the room level only.
Andrew (50:45-50:45): Not.
Andrew (50:46-50:46): Not.
Andrew (50:46-50:48): There's outlets on that wall.
Andrew (50:48-50:48): I'm talking.
Andrew (50:48-50:54): Is there a global room information that you generally need to know?
Bryan (50:55-50:57): Cathedral ceiling.
Bryan (50:57-50:58): Floor to ceiling.
Andrew (51:04-51:05): Floor to ceiling.
Bryan (51:05-51:06): What are the.
Bryan (51:06-51:11): Is the cabinets floor to ceiling if there's a cathedral ceiling or a gable.
Andrew (51:11-51:15): Is floor to ceiling if the cabinet's floor to ceiling.
Andrew (51:15-51:19): To do more with a room location like that wall, maybe.
Andrew (51:19-51:19): Yeah.
Andrew (51:19-51:21): So that's not at the room level.
Andrew (51:21-51:23): What else is there to know except for the room name?
Bryan (51:24-51:28): Oh, obviously like the name, what floor it's on.
Andrew (51:28-51:30): I've got that what PDF page numbers.
Bryan (51:32-51:33): I think that's enough.
Bryan (51:33-51:35): I think this is an example of.
Bryan (51:35-51:37): You've done a lot of work that's Good, let's test it.
Bryan (51:37-51:37): Test it.
Andrew (51:37-51:38): And that's what I'm saying to you.
Andrew (51:38-51:40): Like that's why I'm asking you right now.
Andrew (51:40-51:41): I'm testing it and going like.
Andrew (51:41-51:42): Because that's all I have.
Andrew (51:42-51:44): I just have room to like what's in.
Bryan (51:44-51:45): Looks like another job.
Andrew (51:46-51:52): And just try to think as global as possible because we're gonna, we're gonna come down in granularly.
Bryan (51:53-51:55): This is approved.
Bryan (51:56-51:57): 25 Sankey.
Bryan (51:57-52:00): This is a big nasty one and it's a weird one.
Bryan (52:01-52:03): So here is the kitchen.
Andrew (52:03-52:04): Sankiriya approved.
Bryan (52:05-52:08): Okay, so it's kitchen 104.
Andrew (52:08-52:08): Okay.
Andrew (52:08-52:10): What do we need to know about that kitchen?
Andrew (52:10-52:13): Are there any customer related things or things that we need to know?
Andrew (52:13-52:14): We need access.
Andrew (52:17-52:18): Access, what else?
Andrew (52:37-52:39): So for me it's like things like access dimensions.
Andrew (52:39-52:43): Because if you can't get into the room, like what do I need to know?
Andrew (52:43-52:44): Like from the room level.
Andrew (52:45-52:46): I don't care how tall it is.
Andrew (52:46-52:52): If I had no way of pushing, like you have to build your cabinets to this spec because we have to get it through the door.
Andrew (52:52-52:54): What else at the room level?
Bryan (52:59-53:01): Maybe wall type?
Andrew (53:02-53:03): Wall type would be room location.
Bryan (53:05-53:06): If it's wallpaper or if it's plaster.
Andrew (53:07-53:09): Yeah, that'll be at room location.
Bryan (53:10-53:10): Let's probably hit that.
Andrew (53:10-53:11): Okay, cool.
Andrew (53:11-53:12): All right, let's move to the next level.
Andrew (53:13-53:15): So the only thing I'm missing from that is access.
Andrew (53:15-53:16): Okay, room location.
Andrew (53:20-53:21): What type of location it is?
Andrew (53:21-53:22): Is it a wall?
Andrew (53:22-53:23): Is it an island?
Bryan (53:23-53:23): It is.
Andrew (53:23-53:25): Is it a peninsula?
Andrew (53:25-53:29): Like what area of the room and is it going to occupy?
Andrew (53:30-53:33): So that includes things like things I need to know about room locations.
Andrew (53:33-53:39): Are there outlets to consider like where we're installing it in the room?
Andrew (53:39-53:41): So tell me about that.
Andrew (53:43-53:48): What do I need to consider about a project based on just.
Andrew (53:48-53:49): So look at that wall.
Andrew (53:49-53:50): We're building a cabinet there.
Andrew (53:50-53:51): What do you need to know?
Andrew (53:52-53:53): So floor to.
Andrew (53:55-53:56): No, that's in the cabinet.
Andrew (53:56-53:57): That's in the next.
Bryan (53:57-53:57): Electrical.
Bryan (53:57-53:58): Plumbing.
Andrew (53:58-53:58): Electrical.
Andrew (53:59-54:01): And what kind of notes would be.
Andrew (54:01-54:04): Would you just want generic open notes where you just type whatever?
Bryan (54:04-54:07): Yeah, probably same plumbing is you want a center line?
Andrew (54:08-54:09): What's the center line?
Andrew (54:09-54:10): Tell me about that.
Bryan (54:10-54:12): The center line to a drain.
Andrew (54:14-54:17): What's the actual field and what's the information that goes in there?
Bryan (54:18-54:21): It is a inches field.
Andrew (54:21-54:22): Yeah.
Bryan (54:22-54:23): A length field.
Andrew (54:23-54:24): Yeah.
Andrew (54:24-54:27): Is it, is it a XY position or is it just a.
Bryan (54:28-54:31): It is a X. I guess it would be xy.
Bryan (54:31-54:31): Yeah.
Bryan (54:31-54:32): XY would be good.
Bryan (54:33-54:35): Okay, then X would Orient it off.
Andrew (54:35-54:37): A particular wall and electrical outlet.
Andrew (54:37-54:39): X, Y as well, I would put.
Bryan (54:39-54:40): As an option, but.
Andrew (54:40-54:41): Yeah, but they're both options.
Andrew (54:41-54:42): They're both going to be options.
Andrew (54:42-54:42): Okay.
Andrew (54:42-54:43): Yeah.
Andrew (54:43-54:45): Because sometimes you won't have a thing there.
Andrew (54:46-54:46): Okay.
Bryan (54:46-54:47): Same thing with a window.
Bryan (54:47-54:50): Window and a door and casing.
Bryan (54:51-54:54): And actually with both of those, it's window casing and door casing.
Bryan (54:54-54:56): We don't care about the actual window.
Bryan (54:56-54:56): I don't care what it is.
Andrew (54:56-54:59): Casing and door casing.
Andrew (54:59-55:01): And what is the measurement for that?
Bryan (55:01-55:05): It's gonna be like overall and then some sort of xy.
Andrew (55:06-55:09): Okay, so dimensions and position.
Andrew (55:10-55:11): Okay.
Andrew (55:11-55:13): And they're inches.
Bryan (55:13-55:15): Inches, not feet.
Bryan (55:15-55:16): Inches.
Andrew (55:17-55:17): Okay.
Andrew (55:17-55:19): Inches from where?
Andrew (55:19-55:20): Right.
Bryan (55:20-55:24): It probably should be a text field.
Andrew (55:24-55:25): Because are we setting an origin?
Andrew (55:27-55:29): We like just internally.
Andrew (55:29-55:30): What's our origin?
Andrew (55:30-55:30): Bottom left?
Bryan (55:32-55:33): No, we should not do that.
Bryan (55:33-55:37): Because if you look at a wall and you're coming off the right side or left side, it's going to be completely different.
Andrew (55:37-55:43): Okay, so why don't I just set a field as origin left or right?
Bryan (55:43-55:43): Yeah.
Andrew (55:43-55:44): Okay.
Andrew (55:45-55:46): Is it bottom left, bottom right?
Bryan (55:47-55:47): Probably.
Andrew (55:48-55:49): Do you never origin up there?
Bryan (55:50-55:51): Probably not.
Andrew (55:51-55:54): Okay, I'm just gonna give you the quadrant.
Andrew (55:54-55:55): Yeah.
Andrew (55:55-55:55): Okay.
Andrew (55:58-55:59): Okay.
Andrew (55:59-56:03): So after room location, we have cabinet run.
Andrew (56:03-56:10): Now, what we consider a cabinet run is multiple cabinets in a position on that wall.
Andrew (56:10-56:43): So looking at our plan here, This is a room location.
Andrew (56:43-57:02): Inside the room location is a cabinet front, SW base, sink, wall base, cabinets inside SW base is Bo1, Bo2, Bo3, and then 4.
Andrew (57:05-57:06): Yeah, yeah.
Andrew (57:06-57:07): However you want to.
Andrew (57:08-57:08): Right.
Andrew (57:08-57:09): Whatever you want to do.
Andrew (57:09-57:16): And then so like, let's go and talk about that, because this is how I would do it.
Andrew (57:16-57:16): Right.
Andrew (57:16-57:19): So the next one is cabinet runs.
Andrew (57:19-57:19): So how.
Andrew (57:20-57:23): What information is cabinet run level?
Andrew (57:24-57:25): That will come down.
Andrew (57:26-57:27): So.
Andrew (57:27-57:29): And I'll explain it to you from a pricing point of view.
Andrew (57:29-57:30): So that makes sense as well.
Andrew (57:30-57:36): So when you are pricing, do you want to look at a room location?
Andrew (57:36-57:38): Like, so I built the pricing structure.
Andrew (57:38-57:39): So it's hierarchical.
Andrew (57:39-57:47): What I mean is if you go to a room location and you say, these are all Level 1 cabinets, the pricing will move down.
Andrew (57:48-57:50): So, like, everything in there is going to be this material.
Andrew (57:51-57:55): It's going to be this thing, this hardware, this thing.
Andrew (57:55-57:56): So do you.
Andrew (57:56-58:02): You are able to determine what the products are at a global level.
Andrew (58:02-58:03): You can determine the type.
Andrew (58:03-58:07): And then when you get down to the cabinet, you're like, I need three door hinges.
Andrew (58:07-58:11): We know that the three door hinges are this type.
Andrew (58:11-58:13): Now do you want to Determine that at the.
Andrew (58:15-58:18): But with overrides in the specific levels.
Andrew (58:18-58:21): So let's say that you determine all of this to be this particular Blum hardware.
Andrew (58:21-58:27): But when you get down to that special one in the corner and you change the hardware, it only changes at that level.
Andrew (58:27-58:29): So it has hierarchical.
Andrew (58:31-58:32): Does that kind of make sense?
Andrew (58:32-58:33): So you can go in.
Andrew (58:34-58:35): Because I'm just trying to think of you.
Andrew (58:35-58:41): Let's say that they've decided they want to change all the hardware for this base cabinet run.
Andrew (58:42-58:45): Then you should just be able to go to the cabinet run and change it.
Andrew (58:45-58:47): And it changes for all the cabinets.
Andrew (58:48-58:49): Does that kind of make sense?
Andrew (58:49-58:54): Or like, oh, we're changing the color of just this one cabinet in the corner.
Andrew (58:54-58:55): They want to paint a different color.
Andrew (58:55-58:58): Then you go down to the cabinet and you can change that.
Andrew (58:58-59:01): So there's a specification hierarchy kind of thing.
Andrew (59:01-59:10): So at the cabinet run level, tell me what specifications I need to include so you can fill it in.
Andrew (59:13-59:14): So that includes.
Andrew (59:14-59:15): So let's go through that together.
Andrew (59:15-59:16): Can you grab something to write on.
Bryan (59:16-59:17): A number of magnets?
Andrew (59:19-59:24): Use Sankity in front of you or use friendship lane, or use one of them in front of you so that we can do this.
Andrew (59:30-59:34): Now you won't do linear feeds at the cabinet run level.
Andrew (59:34-59:38): You'll do it at the cabinet level, and then it'll escalate up to the cabinet run.
Andrew (59:46-59:47): Actually draw this.
Andrew (59:47-59:47): Yeah.
Andrew (59:47-59:52): Okay, so we have project.
Bryan (59:53-59:56): We have room.
Andrew (59:59-01:00:09): Then we have room location, we have cabinet run.
Andrew (01:00:10-01:00:14): Then we have cabinet, and then we have.
Andrew (01:00:14-01:00:15): Which is.
Andrew (01:00:16-01:00:21): Haven't done yet, but like sub cabin.
Andrew (01:00:23-01:00:26): And that's like doors and so on and so forth.
Andrew (01:00:26-01:00:30): Okay, so at the project level, we have customer details.
Andrew (01:00:30-01:00:31): Access.
Andrew (01:00:32-01:00:33): Right?
Andrew (01:00:34-01:00:35): At the room level, we have access.
Andrew (01:00:37-01:00:37): We have.
Andrew (01:00:38-01:00:41): What do we agree to access?
Andrew (01:00:42-01:00:45): That's really all we need for a room, you know?
Andrew (01:00:47-01:00:48): Yeah, that's basic.
Andrew (01:00:48-01:00:48): Yeah.
Andrew (01:00:49-01:00:58): Location, we have electrical and plumbing and wind fixtures.
Andrew (01:01:00-01:01:01): Okay.
Andrew (01:01:01-01:01:07): And then at the cabinet run level, that's where dividing tops and bottoms and tall.
Bryan (01:01:08-01:01:08): Okay.
Andrew (01:01:09-01:01:09): Right.
Andrew (01:01:09-01:01:11): What am I defining here?
Andrew (01:01:11-01:01:16): So I feel like cabinet run level has floor to ceiling, like for.
Andrew (01:01:16-01:01:18): For like tall, explicitly.
Andrew (01:01:18-01:01:19): So what.
Andrew (01:01:19-01:01:20): What types am I missing?
Bryan (01:01:21-01:01:25): Yeah, Base cabinets, upper cabinets, pantry, cabinets, appliances.
Andrew (01:01:25-01:01:26): What's pantry?
Bryan (01:01:27-01:01:27): A floor ceiling.
Andrew (01:01:27-01:01:31): So we just call it full because that could be a closet.
Andrew (01:01:31-01:01:31): Yeah, right.
Andrew (01:01:31-01:01:32): What else is that?
Bryan (01:01:33-01:01:34): Appliances.
Andrew (01:01:35-01:01:38): No, appliance is not a cabinet run.
Andrew (01:01:38-01:01:41): It is technically a cabinet type.
Bryan (01:01:42-01:01:43): These are cabin types.
Bryan (01:01:43-01:01:44): Bases and uppers.
Andrew (01:01:44-01:01:46): No, it's a base run.
Bryan (01:01:46-01:01:47): Oh, oh.
Andrew (01:01:47-01:01:48): And then an upper run.
Bryan (01:01:48-01:01:49): Okay.
Andrew (01:01:49-01:01:52): And then any full length Things are included as their own run.
Bryan (01:01:53-01:01:55): You could probably put trim in there or wall panel.
Bryan (01:01:57-01:02:02): Because you could have a wall with no cabinets and trim and no cabinets and wallpaper.
Bryan (01:02:02-01:02:02): Okay.
Andrew (01:02:02-01:02:07): So paneling it together or separate.
Andrew (01:02:09-01:02:09): Cool.
Bryan (01:02:10-01:02:11): And we do make doors.
Bryan (01:02:11-01:02:13): We could probably doors as a separate.
Andrew (01:02:14-01:02:14): Okay.
Bryan (01:02:14-01:02:15): Like passage doors.
Bryan (01:02:15-01:02:16): Passage doors in particular.
Bryan (01:02:16-01:02:17): Okay.
Andrew (01:02:17-01:02:23): Which means these guys need their own trim, paneling, and doors need their own sub things.
Bryan (01:02:23-01:02:24): Yeah.
Andrew (01:02:27-01:02:28): Okay.
Bryan (01:02:28-01:02:31): This is an example of something we don't have to.
Bryan (01:02:31-01:02:32): To flush out now.
Bryan (01:02:32-01:02:33): Like, you can flush.
Andrew (01:02:33-01:02:33): Oh, I know that.
Andrew (01:02:34-01:02:36): I'm not worrying about this right now.
Andrew (01:02:38-01:02:40): Okay, so then at the cabinet level.
Andrew (01:02:42-01:02:43): So in cabinet run, what else am I defining?
Andrew (01:02:43-01:02:46): I'm not just determining cabinet run type.
Andrew (01:02:46-01:02:48): What else do I need to know about cabinet runs?
Andrew (01:02:48-01:02:49): If you're grouping a whole set.
Andrew (01:02:50-01:02:51): So things that.
Andrew (01:02:51-01:02:52): What can you determine this level?
Bryan (01:02:52-01:02:53): Can you.
Andrew (01:02:53-01:02:56): Do you want to set pricing or do you want to set at the cabinet level?
Bryan (01:03:03-01:03:04): I guess you could be done here.
Bryan (01:03:04-01:03:05): Yeah.
Andrew (01:03:05-01:03:06): Okay.
Andrew (01:03:07-01:03:10): Do you want to set measurements of the.
Andrew (01:03:10-01:03:12): Do you want to record the measurements of a run?
Andrew (01:03:13-01:03:15): Like, how long is it from this end to that end?
Bryan (01:03:15-01:03:17): So let's say there's a job that's already drawn.
Bryan (01:03:17-01:03:18): It's already defined.
Andrew (01:03:19-01:03:20): I get that.
Andrew (01:03:20-01:03:24): But it actually needs to be extracted from that definition because those numbers can be used.
Andrew (01:03:24-01:03:27): Like, that's the important thing to know here.
Andrew (01:03:27-01:03:35): Like, for example, if you start speccing out these cabinets and your math doesn't map it, I need to red flag you.
Bryan (01:03:36-01:03:36): Okay.
Andrew (01:03:36-01:03:37): Do you get what I'm saying?
Andrew (01:03:37-01:03:40): Like, if we start building all these cabinets, it's this link, this link.
Andrew (01:03:40-01:03:45): And then it comes back and it's like, hey, that's not what you said for 50.
Bryan (01:03:45-01:03:46): And you're building 70.
Andrew (01:03:46-01:03:47): 100%.
Andrew (01:03:47-01:03:55): So like, there are things that you can set here, like pricing specifications and what kind of specific.
Andrew (01:03:55-01:03:56): Like, let's talk.
Andrew (01:03:56-01:03:57): Let's look at your plan.
Andrew (01:03:57-01:03:58): Let's pick a.
Andrew (01:03:58-01:03:58): Pick a page.
Andrew (01:04:17-01:04:17): So.
Andrew (01:04:22-01:04:23): Okay, cool.
Andrew (01:04:24-01:04:25): So this is a run.
Andrew (01:04:25-01:04:27): This whole box thing is a run.
Andrew (01:04:28-01:04:35): So the thing is, the reason I kept run in there and didn't just do cabinets is for a pricing and logistics for paying staff.
Bryan (01:04:36-01:04:36): Okay.
Andrew (01:04:36-01:04:41): What I'd like you to be able to do is say, hey, Levi, this base is yours.
Andrew (01:04:41-01:04:43): And Shaggy, you've got the uppers.
Andrew (01:04:44-01:04:45): And then walk away.
Andrew (01:04:46-01:04:49): And every detail should be inspect out for them.
Andrew (01:04:49-01:04:49): Right.
Andrew (01:04:50-01:04:53): Because then we know how much this costs, how much to do it.
Andrew (01:04:53-01:04:54): And then like all that.
Andrew (01:04:54-01:04:55): Right.
Andrew (01:04:55-01:04:59): So that's why I didn't just go, you are assigned this cabinet.
Andrew (01:04:59-01:05:00): You're doing this.
Andrew (01:05:00-01:05:00): You're doing this.
Andrew (01:05:00-01:05:03): It gives you the option without that grouping, we can't do it.
Andrew (01:05:03-01:05:11): Now, looking at that, at the cabinet run level, what details can you give or you want to enter?
Andrew (01:05:11-01:05:14): Let's say you're entering this in the way that I just told you.
Andrew (01:05:14-01:05:14): Okay.
Andrew (01:05:14-01:05:16): So you've determined this is the room location.
Andrew (01:05:16-01:05:17): This is K1.
Andrew (01:05:17-01:05:19): It's kitchen, sink, wall.
Bryan (01:05:20-01:05:20): Okay.
Andrew (01:05:20-01:05:21): Right.
Andrew (01:05:21-01:05:22): So the next spec is.
Andrew (01:05:22-01:05:25): I see two sets of things.
Bryan (01:05:26-01:05:27): You mean like uppers and lowers?
Andrew (01:05:27-01:05:28): Uppers and lowers.
Andrew (01:05:28-01:05:29): Okay, so.
Bryan (01:05:29-01:05:32): And even though this is just shells, you could call it uppers.
Andrew (01:05:32-01:05:33): Yeah, it's an upper.
Andrew (01:05:33-01:05:33): Yeah.
Andrew (01:05:33-01:05:34): So this is upper one.
Bryan (01:05:35-01:05:36): Okay.
Andrew (01:05:36-01:05:36): Yeah.
Andrew (01:05:36-01:05:37): Because they are built separately.
Andrew (01:05:37-01:05:37): Right.
Andrew (01:05:38-01:05:42): So inside, upper cabinet run is upper one and upper two.
Andrew (01:05:42-01:05:45): And then down here we have base.
Bryan (01:05:45-01:05:47): You have one run of lowers.
Andrew (01:05:47-01:05:47): Yeah.
Bryan (01:05:48-01:05:50): Two base cabinets and an appliance.
Andrew (01:05:50-01:05:52): Okay, so where's the two base cabinets?
Andrew (01:05:52-01:05:53): One.
Andrew (01:05:53-01:05:53): Yep.
Bryan (01:05:54-01:05:54): Two.
Andrew (01:05:54-01:05:55): Okay.
Andrew (01:05:55-01:05:59): And then how do you want to do defining cabinets?
Andrew (01:06:02-01:06:04): So in my annotation, you've seen the way that I've got it.
Andrew (01:06:04-01:06:08): Basically what I'm gonna have you do is you get to draw K1.
Andrew (01:06:09-01:06:11): Like this is K1.
Andrew (01:06:11-01:06:13): And then I've got it disabled right now.
Andrew (01:06:13-01:06:18): But when you double click on it just isolates that box and you can draw another box inside.
Bryan (01:06:18-01:06:20): And you're only doing it from plan view.
Andrew (01:06:20-01:06:22): No, you can do this from any.
Bryan (01:06:22-01:06:25): View page three and it can be on different pages.
Bryan (01:06:25-01:06:26): K1.
Andrew (01:06:26-01:06:26): Correct.
Andrew (01:06:26-01:06:27): Look.
Andrew (01:06:27-01:06:30): So I built you a tree that has.
Andrew (01:06:30-01:06:32): That unifies everything together.
Andrew (01:06:32-01:06:44): So you can draw the plan view, the front view, and then later on, when you finish doing this part, you can pull a page report for that cabinet and it gives you the plan, it gives you the elevation for it, and it gives you all the specs that you did.
Andrew (01:06:44-01:06:48): You can pull a cabinet run report, and it gives you the entire cabinet run report.
Andrew (01:06:49-01:06:56): But the idea of why this is taking so long is to make sure that I built this universal structure and that I can have it do whatever you need it to do.
Bryan (01:06:56-01:06:59): But what it can't do is what it doesn't have.
Bryan (01:06:59-01:07:02): It can't pull the face frame dimensions.
Andrew (01:07:02-01:07:04): It can if you write them in.
Bryan (01:07:04-01:07:10): I can't write them in this PDF in a clean way.
Bryan (01:07:10-01:07:14): It's so much cleaner to do it just through Rhino and do a separate page.
Andrew (01:07:14-01:07:15): So that's what I'm saying.
Andrew (01:07:16-01:07:16): I am going.
Andrew (01:07:17-01:07:17): I'm building.
Andrew (01:07:17-01:07:24): I need to know what is the specific full spec for a cabinet so that you can.
Andrew (01:07:24-01:07:25): It can be Populated.
Andrew (01:07:25-01:07:29): I can find a way to auto populate from Rhino later if need be.
Andrew (01:07:29-01:07:30): But that's a bonus thing.
Andrew (01:07:30-01:07:33): But there needs to be a manual place that's written down.
Andrew (01:07:33-01:07:37): Hey, this cabinet, the face frames of this, the kick is going to be this or the.
Andrew (01:07:37-01:07:38): This has a kick.
Andrew (01:07:38-01:07:39): It doesn't have a kick.
Andrew (01:07:39-01:07:41): Like all of those things we are about to get to.
Andrew (01:07:41-01:07:42): And you have to give me.
Andrew (01:07:42-01:07:50): So that when you're going through this spot, if it's not you, it can be the detailer who's looking for details and just ticking.
Andrew (01:07:50-01:07:51): This has a kick.
Andrew (01:07:52-01:07:54): And then what is the kick dimension?
Andrew (01:07:54-01:07:55): What is the kick field?
Andrew (01:07:55-01:07:56): What is the blah, blah.
Andrew (01:07:57-01:07:59): That's what I need to finalize that.
Andrew (01:07:59-01:08:01): When we're going through this and we get over to.
Andrew (01:08:06-01:08:13): New cabinet, You click on new cabinet.
Andrew (01:08:13-01:08:14): Oh, this is cabinet run.
Andrew (01:08:14-01:08:17): But you click on new cabinet and then it has all the things for the cabinet.
Andrew (01:08:17-01:08:19): Add a door, add a.
Andrew (01:08:21-01:08:23): So that we have everything granulated.
Andrew (01:08:23-01:08:28): So what we talked about that job summary spec is what I'm already building.
Bryan (01:08:28-01:08:29): Yeah, I like that.
Bryan (01:08:29-01:08:30): That is a job summary spec.
Bryan (01:08:30-01:08:40): I don't think that it's the task card picture that they'll need, which is okay because I think it's going to generate the.
Andrew (01:08:42-01:08:47): So my goal in what I'm currently working on is when.
Andrew (01:08:51-01:08:56): It's here, it's at this point here.
Andrew (01:08:57-01:09:02): So it's what can you get pre Rhino and what can't you get?
Andrew (01:09:02-01:09:03): Or what do you need after Rhino?
Andrew (01:09:03-01:09:05): Yeah, you tell me.
Bryan (01:09:05-01:09:06): Okay, so.
Bryan (01:09:06-01:09:09): So pre Rhino, we can get this whole job summary.
Bryan (01:09:09-01:09:16): We can look at the drawings and we can get a total quantity for hardware because we can see hinges, we can see slides, we can see blind corners.
Bryan (01:09:18-01:09:24): We can get names, which is a big thing, just to name every single cabinet to know what it's supposed to be.
Bryan (01:09:25-01:09:31): We can get style with the cabinet door.
Bryan (01:09:31-01:09:32): Profiles are.
Bryan (01:09:33-01:09:36): We can get species if there's hardwood.
Bryan (01:09:37-01:09:39): We can figure out quantity of.
Bryan (01:09:40-01:09:42): We can figure out how much we're building.
Bryan (01:09:42-01:09:49): Linear footage, cabinetry, millwork, countertops and float gels.
Andrew (01:09:50-01:09:54): Okay, so materials type.
Andrew (01:09:54-01:09:55): Material type.
Andrew (01:09:55-01:09:56): Type.
Andrew (01:09:56-01:09:57): Yeah, quantity.
Andrew (01:09:57-01:09:59): I'm talking material type.
Andrew (01:09:59-01:10:02): We can get linear feeds for cabinets.
Andrew (01:10:02-01:10:04): Yeah, we can get hardware.
Andrew (01:10:05-01:10:05): Yes.
Andrew (01:10:05-01:10:07): Because hardware selection can be done.
Andrew (01:10:07-01:10:08): Yes.
Andrew (01:10:11-01:10:12): Cool.
Bryan (01:10:12-01:10:13): So that'd be cool because then it.
Andrew (01:10:13-01:10:15): Would spit right into the BOM 100%.
Andrew (01:10:15-01:10:23): Now, my dream thing and what I know I can do is I can spin from that because it's in a database.
Andrew (01:10:23-01:10:29): I can spit an actual Rhino file, not the actual drawing of The Rhino files.
Andrew (01:10:29-01:10:32): But I can spit the pages for cabinets.
Andrew (01:10:32-01:10:39): I can spit layers, I can spit anything that we have defined in any way that you want in Rhino.
Andrew (01:10:39-01:10:46): I have the way right now to make a Rhino file with pre made layers custom every time.
Andrew (01:10:46-01:10:47): I can already do it.
Andrew (01:10:47-01:10:55): I have a way that I. I can import pages in and have that set up in the way that you need it to.
Andrew (01:10:56-01:11:07): And so my goal is, what I need you inside Rhino is the things that you don't have measurements for to in Rhino.
Andrew (01:11:07-01:11:13): Just draw it in a very specific way that I can program a computer to read those things every time.
Andrew (01:11:16-01:11:17): That's what I need.
Andrew (01:11:17-01:11:23): But right now the manual way is you have to fill in the form with those details.
Andrew (01:11:24-01:11:30): Now what are those fields that you need to get the job done?
Andrew (01:11:30-01:11:33): That's what I need to get from you in right up.
Andrew (01:11:33-01:11:33): Yeah.
Andrew (01:11:33-01:11:37): What other things that the guys need to know like face frames, how far is the kit?
Andrew (01:11:37-01:11:38): How's it assembled?
Andrew (01:11:38-01:11:40): Those things are.
Andrew (01:11:40-01:11:41): Are the things I don't know.
Andrew (01:11:42-01:11:43): Okay.
Andrew (01:11:44-01:11:44): Okay.
Andrew (01:11:45-01:11:47): So what are those things for a cabinet?
Andrew (01:11:47-01:11:48): Are we still recording, right?
Bryan (01:11:48-01:11:49): Yeah, I think so.
Bryan (01:11:50-01:11:52): You would have type of face frame.
Andrew (01:11:52-01:11:53): Okay.
Bryan (01:11:54-01:11:58): You would have finish stain grater paint.
Andrew (01:11:59-01:11:59): Okay.
Bryan (01:11:59-01:12:00): If it's stain grade, you'd have speed.
Andrew (01:12:00-01:12:02): So we already know that.
Bryan (01:12:03-01:12:04): Isn't that what you're asking about?
Andrew (01:12:04-01:12:06): I'm talking about post rhyme.
Andrew (01:12:06-01:12:08): So yeah, just go he box.
Bryan (01:12:08-01:12:08): Okay.
Bryan (01:12:09-01:12:10): Toe kicks.
Bryan (01:12:11-01:12:12): Toe kick doesn't change.
Andrew (01:12:12-01:12:14): We always have toe kicks.
Bryan (01:12:14-01:12:16): No, it would just be is it or not?
Andrew (01:12:16-01:12:17): Okay.
Andrew (01:12:17-01:12:17): Yeah.
Andrew (01:12:18-01:12:19): Look at an actual drawing.
Andrew (01:12:20-01:12:20): Yeah, yeah.
Bryan (01:12:22-01:12:23): Door profile.
Andrew (01:12:24-01:12:25): Okay.
Andrew (01:12:25-01:12:26): If there is a door or not.
Bryan (01:12:27-01:12:28): Yeah, yeah.
Andrew (01:12:28-01:12:29): So you have to.
Andrew (01:12:29-01:12:31): You have to work down for me.
Andrew (01:12:31-01:12:32): So look out the cabinet.
Bryan (01:12:32-01:12:33): Yep.
Andrew (01:12:33-01:12:39): What globally exists for every cabinet finish material.
Andrew (01:12:40-01:12:40): What else?
Andrew (01:12:47-01:12:47): I don't know.
Andrew (01:12:48-01:12:49): Just finished material really.
Andrew (01:12:50-01:12:50): Right.
Andrew (01:12:53-01:12:55): And so the cabinet run will determine its type.
Andrew (01:12:55-01:12:57): So four, let's go base cabinets now.
Andrew (01:12:57-01:12:59): Four base cabinets.
Andrew (01:12:59-01:13:01): What are the elements of a base cabinet?
Bryan (01:13:04-01:13:06): Like what types could you have?
Andrew (01:13:06-01:13:06): No.
Andrew (01:13:06-01:13:09): So we'll deal with subs in a second.
Andrew (01:13:09-01:13:10): So in terms of the construction of.
Bryan (01:13:10-01:13:12): A box, just the face frame or European.
Andrew (01:13:13-01:13:14): Okay, so face frame.
Andrew (01:13:14-01:13:14): Tell me about that.
Bryan (01:13:15-01:13:16): A face frame cabinet.
Andrew (01:13:16-01:13:16): Yeah.
Andrew (01:13:16-01:13:18): Or European.
Andrew (01:13:18-01:13:18): Okay, cool.
Andrew (01:13:19-01:13:19): What else?
Andrew (01:13:22-01:13:23): Think globally.
Bryan (01:13:23-01:13:27): Just pure box, drawers, doors open.
Andrew (01:13:27-01:13:28): We're gonna go there now.
Andrew (01:13:28-01:13:28): So then.
Andrew (01:13:28-01:13:29): Okay, so that's it.
Andrew (01:13:29-01:13:32): Just what type of face frame?
Andrew (01:13:33-01:13:34): Does it have a kick?
Andrew (01:13:34-01:13:35): Does it not?
Andrew (01:13:35-01:13:35): Yes.
Andrew (01:13:35-01:13:36): No, For a kick.
Andrew (01:13:36-01:13:37): So this is base.
Andrew (01:13:37-01:13:38): We're talking base.
Andrew (01:13:39-01:13:40): What do we do about countertop?
Andrew (01:13:40-01:13:41): Does it need a top?
Andrew (01:13:42-01:13:42): Sure.
Andrew (01:13:43-01:13:45): Like, because Sometimes you build a cabinet without a top, right?
Andrew (01:13:45-01:13:46): Yeah.
Bryan (01:13:46-01:13:47): Like if it's stone.
Andrew (01:13:48-01:13:48): Okay.
Andrew (01:13:48-01:13:49): It doesn't need a tongue.
Andrew (01:13:49-01:13:50): What else?
Andrew (01:13:55-01:13:55): And then a notes.
Andrew (01:13:56-01:13:57): Right, that's general notes.
Andrew (01:13:58-01:13:58): What else?
Andrew (01:13:59-01:14:02): Before you go into detail about sub components inside.
Bryan (01:14:05-01:14:06): I think those are pretty cool.
Andrew (01:14:06-01:14:11): Okay, so then the next part is what sub components exist?
Bryan (01:14:13-01:14:17): Doors, drawers, shelving, pull outs.
Andrew (01:14:17-01:14:18): Yeah, pull outs.
Andrew (01:14:18-01:14:18): What else?
Bryan (01:14:19-01:14:20): End panels.
Andrew (01:14:21-01:14:22): End panels.
Andrew (01:14:22-01:14:22): Okay, cool.
Andrew (01:14:22-01:14:23): Does this have an end panel?
Andrew (01:14:23-01:14:25): So that's actually in the global level.
Andrew (01:14:25-01:14:27): Is this an end panel one?
Bryan (01:14:27-01:14:28): Okay.
Andrew (01:14:28-01:14:28): You know what I mean?
Andrew (01:14:28-01:14:29): Yeah.
Andrew (01:14:29-01:14:30): Because not all of them have end panels.
Andrew (01:14:30-01:14:31): No.
Andrew (01:14:31-01:14:31): Yeah.
Bryan (01:14:31-01:14:35): And then is it a decorative end panel or is it a flat end panel?
Andrew (01:14:35-01:14:35): Cool.
Andrew (01:14:36-01:14:37): Look at the picture.
Andrew (01:14:37-01:14:38): What else is that?
Bryan (01:14:38-01:14:39): Appliance returns.
Bryan (01:14:40-01:14:41): Farmhouse sinks.
Andrew (01:14:43-01:14:45): No, don't do farmhouse yet.
Andrew (01:14:45-01:14:45): So, like.
Andrew (01:14:45-01:14:46): Oh, no, it is.
Andrew (01:14:47-01:14:48): There's a type of base cabinet.
Andrew (01:14:49-01:14:53): There's end, there's sink, and there's appliance.
Andrew (01:14:54-01:14:56): Okay, right.
Andrew (01:14:56-01:14:57): So like, is it on an end?
Andrew (01:14:59-01:15:00): Is it a sink cabinet?
Andrew (01:15:01-01:15:03): Is it an appliance cabinet?
Bryan (01:15:04-01:15:05): Is it a middle cabinet?
Andrew (01:15:06-01:15:08): No, because middle is going to be the generic.
Bryan (01:15:08-01:15:09): Okay.
Andrew (01:15:09-01:15:09): Yeah.
Bryan (01:15:10-01:15:11): Inside corner, blind corner.
Andrew (01:15:12-01:15:13): Inside corner, blind corner.
Andrew (01:15:13-01:15:14): Okay, cool.
Andrew (01:15:14-01:15:15): So that's great.
Andrew (01:15:15-01:15:16): So let's go.
Andrew (01:15:17-01:15:18): Let's go with just generic.
Andrew (01:15:20-01:15:22): Let's talk about what are the sub component types.
Andrew (01:15:22-01:15:27): They are shelf, drawer, door, pull out.
Andrew (01:15:28-01:15:29): Pull out?
Bryan (01:15:29-01:15:31): Yeah, like you open a door and you have a pull out.
Andrew (01:15:31-01:15:32): Okay, cool.
Andrew (01:15:32-01:15:39): What other types of things can be a sub cabinet thing, open shelving.
Andrew (01:15:39-01:15:40): That's already.
Andrew (01:15:40-01:15:42): Yeah, that's it.
Andrew (01:15:42-01:15:43): Okay, cool.
Andrew (01:15:43-01:15:47): Now on those sub components, let's walk one by one on doors.
Andrew (01:15:48-01:15:50): What are all the features of a.
Bryan (01:15:50-01:15:54): Door that needs to be profile, type, finish, fabrication?
Andrew (01:15:54-01:15:57): Is the finish ever different from the cabinet for doors?
Andrew (01:15:58-01:15:59): Yeah.
Bryan (01:15:59-01:15:59): Yeah.
Bryan (01:15:59-01:16:04): We did one that was like all painted cabinets and the walnut cabinets.
Andrew (01:16:04-01:16:08): So would it adopt the finish from the cabinet if nothing is defined?
Andrew (01:16:08-01:16:08): Yeah.
Andrew (01:16:08-01:16:09): Okay, cool.
Andrew (01:16:10-01:16:11): Tops.
Andrew (01:16:11-01:16:12): Is that all for doors?
Bryan (01:16:14-01:16:18): Is that where you would say blind hinge or regular hinge?
Andrew (01:16:18-01:16:18): Yes.
Andrew (01:16:18-01:16:20): If it's related to the door, then yes.
Bryan (01:16:20-01:16:20): Yeah.
Bryan (01:16:20-01:16:21): So hinge type.
Andrew (01:16:21-01:16:22): Hinge type.
Andrew (01:16:22-01:16:22): Yeah.
Andrew (01:16:23-01:16:24): Cool.
Andrew (01:16:24-01:16:26): Anything else on doors you did profile?
Bryan (01:16:27-01:16:32): I would do fabrication because we don't cut all doors in the cnc.
Bryan (01:16:32-01:16:35): So they need to know, am I making this five piece or am I making this?
Bryan (01:16:35-01:16:36): Or is this getting CNC'd?
Andrew (01:16:38-01:16:42): Okay, so that CNC passed.
Andrew (01:16:42-01:16:43): Yes or no?
Andrew (01:16:43-01:16:43): Cool.
Andrew (01:16:43-01:16:44): All right, what else?
Bryan (01:16:52-01:16:53): That should define it all.
Bryan (01:16:53-01:16:56): Because the hinge type will define if it's inset or overlay.
Andrew (01:16:58-01:17:01): You need to tell me that the.
Bryan (01:17:01-01:17:03): Hinge Is inset or overlay.
Andrew (01:17:03-01:17:03): Okay.
Andrew (01:17:03-01:17:05): So that's the toggle for hinge type.
Andrew (01:17:05-01:17:07): Inset or overlay?
Bryan (01:17:08-01:17:15): Yeah, if you have a toggle for hinge type, it would be blind inset, half overlay, full overlay.
Bryan (01:17:15-01:17:16): Okay, this is what I need.
Andrew (01:17:16-01:17:16): We have.
Andrew (01:17:16-01:17:17): Okay.
Bryan (01:17:17-01:17:20): Although I guess if we do like a tektus.
Andrew (01:17:21-01:17:25): Okay, so what else is there now?
Bryan (01:17:25-01:17:25): Drawers.
Andrew (01:17:27-01:17:27): Yep.
Andrew (01:17:28-01:17:28): So tell me.
Andrew (01:17:28-01:17:30): So imagine this though.
Andrew (01:17:30-01:17:32): You have to understand what I'm asking you to do here.
Andrew (01:17:33-01:17:41): When you draw a door, you have to go to the door tab and fill in all the door stuff.
Bryan (01:17:42-01:17:45): That's why it's going to better to practice together.
Andrew (01:17:45-01:17:46): I'm just saying.
Andrew (01:17:46-01:17:47): But like, is that something.
Andrew (01:17:47-01:17:48): Yeah, I'm gonna.
Andrew (01:17:48-01:17:48): Yeah.
Bryan (01:17:49-01:17:51): And I have a serious aversion.
Bryan (01:17:51-01:17:55): But I will 100% try because I see what the end goal is.
Andrew (01:17:55-01:17:55): Yeah.
Andrew (01:17:55-01:17:58): And the thing is, I don't want you to do this.
Andrew (01:17:58-01:17:59): I want somebody else to do it.
Andrew (01:17:59-01:18:01): It's not about you.
Andrew (01:18:01-01:18:04): It's about the person who is going to fulfill that role.
Andrew (01:18:04-01:18:08): You hate doing it because you're doing 5,000 other things.
Andrew (01:18:08-01:18:14): But if your job is to spec out a job, you're filling in the details that are going to come up.
Andrew (01:18:14-01:18:14): Because guess what?
Andrew (01:18:15-01:18:16): Those guys are going to ask.
Andrew (01:18:16-01:18:17): What is it?
Andrew (01:18:17-01:18:18): Is it an inset hinge?
Andrew (01:18:18-01:18:19): Is it a boulevard?
Andrew (01:18:19-01:18:21): It should already be there for them.
Andrew (01:18:21-01:18:27): And as well as we've ordered the correct hinge for it, you can see why it's important for you to determine those things.
Andrew (01:18:27-01:18:28): Right?
Andrew (01:18:28-01:18:28): Cool.
Andrew (01:18:29-01:18:31): Doors covered.
Andrew (01:18:31-01:18:35): Is there anything else about doors you.
Bryan (01:18:35-01:18:36): Could do decorative hardware?
Bryan (01:18:36-01:18:37): Like yes or no?
Bryan (01:18:37-01:18:38): If we supply them.
Bryan (01:18:38-01:18:39): Because if it's used.
Andrew (01:18:39-01:18:40): Oh, yeah.
Andrew (01:18:40-01:18:47): Do you want to have hardware as an overall hardware or do you want to determine it at the component level?
Andrew (01:18:52-01:18:53): I don't know.
Andrew (01:18:53-01:18:54): Where would you do it?
Bryan (01:18:57-01:18:58): Decorative hardware?
Andrew (01:18:58-01:18:59): No, just hardware in general.
Andrew (01:19:00-01:19:00): Do you want.
Andrew (01:19:01-01:19:06): Do you want hardware, that whole section, or do you want hardware as like related to its cabinet?
Bryan (01:19:10-01:19:11): I guess related to the cabinets.
Andrew (01:19:11-01:19:12): 40 volt.
Andrew (01:19:12-01:19:12): I bought like many.
Bryan (01:19:12-01:19:14): You got any 40 volt batteries?
Andrew (01:19:15-01:19:16): Is that a 40 volter?
Andrew (01:19:16-01:19:17): Yeah, gold.
Andrew (01:19:18-01:19:18): I know.
Bryan (01:19:18-01:19:19): I bought it to.
Bryan (01:19:19-01:19:22): For Levi so he'd stop using DeWalt.
Bryan (01:19:22-01:19:23): Like a DeWalt.
Andrew (01:19:25-01:19:26): But I don't have to get 40 balls.
Andrew (01:19:28-01:19:29): No, don't have any.
Andrew (01:19:29-01:19:30): This should work.
Andrew (01:19:30-01:19:31): Yeah.
Andrew (01:19:36-01:19:36): Are you going?
Andrew (01:19:36-01:19:40): I mean, what I mean to ask is like when do you want to say that?
Bryan (01:19:40-01:19:42): I think my brain's having a hard time understanding.
Bryan (01:19:42-01:19:52): What I want at the end is a BOM that has all this specific hardware at this point right now, if I'm choosing the hardware type, it doesn't have to be as simple as inset.
Bryan (01:19:52-01:19:55): It could be the blown insert a hardware.
Andrew (01:19:55-01:19:56): I got that.
Andrew (01:19:56-01:20:02): So what, Once we finish doing this, you should get all of the hardware options and then you pick one.
Andrew (01:20:02-01:20:05): So for example, we've got four insets.
Andrew (01:20:05-01:20:09): Then you should select like, it'll say, here are all the hardware.
Andrew (01:20:09-01:20:10): It's a hardware list.
Andrew (01:20:10-01:20:11): And then you go.
Andrew (01:20:11-01:20:13): Then you pick from our inventory what we have.
Andrew (01:20:14-01:20:15): That's the goal.
Andrew (01:20:15-01:20:20): But do you want to say like at the cabinet run level, it's all the same hardware.
Andrew (01:20:20-01:20:22): Do you want to say it at the cabinet level?
Andrew (01:20:23-01:20:25): Every piece of hardware in this cabinet is this.
Andrew (01:20:25-01:20:28): Or do you want it at the component level?
Bryan (01:20:28-01:20:29): What is the component?
Andrew (01:20:29-01:20:30): Doors.
Bryan (01:20:30-01:20:31): It has to be at the component level.
Bryan (01:20:31-01:20:34): Because in one cabinet you could have a blind door and a regular door.
Bryan (01:20:34-01:20:36): So it has to be at the component level.
Andrew (01:20:37-01:20:38): Okay, cool.
Andrew (01:20:38-01:20:39): So you gotta.
Andrew (01:20:39-01:20:41): So you're gonna do that at the component level?
Bryan (01:20:41-01:20:41): Yes.
Bryan (01:20:41-01:20:44): And let's say we have a vanity where the top drawer has to be shallow.
Bryan (01:20:44-01:20:46): So each of those as a component.
Bryan (01:20:46-01:20:46): So they would each be defined.
Bryan (01:20:46-01:20:48): So it has to be at the component level.
Andrew (01:20:48-01:20:48): Okay.
Bryan (01:20:48-01:20:49): So it could have.
Bryan (01:20:49-01:20:50): You could do at the beginning.
Bryan (01:20:50-01:20:54): Like this is all blum inset hardware and you have to change it.
Bryan (01:20:54-01:20:54): That'd be fine.
Andrew (01:20:54-01:20:55): Okay.
Bryan (01:20:55-01:21:00): Because it is predominantly inset blum and it is predominantly 21 inch slides and it's predominantly cert something.
Andrew (01:21:01-01:21:04): So I'll have a default that you can set at any level.
Andrew (01:21:04-01:21:09): So at the cabinet run level, you can have a default to like, I'm selecting this piece of harbor anticipated.
Bryan (01:21:09-01:21:10): Harbor.
Andrew (01:21:10-01:21:10): Yes.
Andrew (01:21:11-01:21:12): Cool, cool.
Andrew (01:21:12-01:21:15): Okay, so we've done doors, drawers.
Andrew (01:21:15-01:21:15): Tell me about it.
Bryan (01:21:16-01:21:17): You don't type.
Bryan (01:21:17-01:21:18): So we can do.
Andrew (01:21:18-01:21:20): Oh, forgot, door dimensions.
Andrew (01:21:21-01:21:22): What are the door dimensions?
Bryan (01:21:23-01:21:24): Yeah, they're not pulled on this PDFs.
Andrew (01:21:24-01:21:25): Yeah, but I need.
Andrew (01:21:25-01:21:27): I need that what is in the final.
Andrew (01:21:27-01:21:30): Like, you'll be able to get it from Rhino.
Andrew (01:21:30-01:21:31): So what are the door dimensions?
Bryan (01:21:33-01:21:34): So let's say I'm doing this now.
Bryan (01:21:34-01:21:36): I have to have this thing over and I have to have Rhino.
Bryan (01:21:36-01:21:38): And after snap dimensions for each one.
Andrew (01:21:38-01:21:41): You should be snapping in there.
Andrew (01:21:41-01:21:43): And later, my ultimate goal is just to pull your snapped thing.
Andrew (01:21:43-01:21:45): If you had snapped it.
Andrew (01:21:49-01:21:53): Once you've written it in Rhino, it should just pull because the door's been labeled correctly.
Andrew (01:21:53-01:21:57): It'll just pull and I'll just label that correctly to match the database.
Andrew (01:21:58-01:21:59): That's my ultimate plan.
Bryan (01:22:00-01:22:00): So.
Andrew (01:22:02-01:22:03): I'm following you.
Andrew (01:22:03-01:22:04): Yeah.
Bryan (01:22:05-01:22:10): I'm generating a blank template Rhino file each time.
Bryan (01:22:10-01:22:16): If this generates for me the Rhino file in a way that is workable.
Bryan (01:22:16-01:22:19): 100%, that would.
Andrew (01:22:20-01:22:21): That would solve.
Andrew (01:22:21-01:22:23): Now, are you drawing at a run level?
Andrew (01:22:23-01:22:24): Are you drawing at a cabinet level?
Andrew (01:22:24-01:22:26): Are you drawing at a component level?
Bryan (01:22:26-01:22:27): Cabinet level.
Andrew (01:22:28-01:22:32): Okay, so if you're drawing at a cabinet level, then I. I can do.
Andrew (01:22:33-01:22:34): Yeah, that's easy.
Andrew (01:22:34-01:22:40): So my preference would actually not be to have you work.
Andrew (01:22:41-01:22:50): Well, the easiest way for me to separate concerns is to have different Rhino files for different cabinets, which is ridiculous because they're huge.
Bryan (01:22:50-01:22:52): Every Single one's like 800 megabytes.
Andrew (01:22:53-01:22:55): A rhino file huge.
Bryan (01:22:58-01:23:01): That's what's bogging down my drive right now.
Andrew (01:23:02-01:23:03): Which is even better.
Andrew (01:23:03-01:23:04): If we do smaller.
Andrew (01:23:04-01:23:05): I need to restroom.
Bryan (01:23:18-01:23:18): It.
Andrew (01:23:44-01:23:44): Sa.
Andrew (01:24:35-01:24:35): It.
Andrew (01:25:10-01:25:10): Okay.
Andrew (01:25:12-01:25:12): Okay.
Andrew (01:25:13-01:25:14): Still recording?
Bryan (01:25:14-01:25:14): Yeah.
Andrew (01:25:14-01:25:15): Okay, cool.
Andrew (01:25:16-01:25:16): Yeah.
Andrew (01:25:16-01:25:17): You were saying?
Bryan (01:25:17-01:25:18): Yeah.
Bryan (01:25:18-01:25:20): So like this one's 70, 85 megabytes.
Bryan (01:25:20-01:25:21): So they get.
Bryan (01:25:21-01:25:21): These get big.
Andrew (01:25:21-01:25:23): Yeah, but that's also like five pages.
Andrew (01:25:24-01:25:28): With 5,000, it'll be the same size, just eight fines.
Bryan (01:25:28-01:25:29): This.
Andrew (01:25:29-01:25:30): Is that the same thing?
Andrew (01:25:32-01:25:33): It's really no different.
Andrew (01:25:36-01:25:37): Do you get what I'm saying?
Andrew (01:25:38-01:25:45): So I can spit out in a kitchen and then organize it by room and then spit out all the cabinets in a room.
Bryan (01:25:46-01:25:47): Here's why I wouldn't like that.
Bryan (01:25:48-01:26:00): When I do a job here and I need to export all the NC file information, I can get every cabinet's worth of pre finish for a job because it's all here.
Andrew (01:26:01-01:26:02): Okay.
Andrew (01:26:02-01:26:03): But if it.
Bryan (01:26:03-01:26:06): If it's set it up like this, I could.
Andrew (01:26:06-01:26:10): Why couldn't I just like write a script that just grabs all those files and just exports it?
Andrew (01:26:11-01:26:12): I can.
Andrew (01:26:13-01:26:14): Let's worry about that when we get there.
Bryan (01:26:14-01:26:15): Okay?
Andrew (01:26:15-01:26:16): That's not a big deal.
Andrew (01:26:16-01:26:21): So right now, if we're not doing it automatically, you have to manually enter those details.
Andrew (01:26:23-01:26:23): Now let's.
Andrew (01:26:23-01:26:29): If we talk about that and you do have the screen detail screen on your laptop and on your big screen drawing.
Andrew (01:26:29-01:26:30): You can do that.
Andrew (01:26:30-01:26:34): Okay, so what in drawers?
Andrew (01:26:36-01:26:37): Doors first.
Andrew (01:26:37-01:26:38): Because we didn't do measurements.
Andrew (01:26:38-01:26:39): What are we measuring?
Andrew (01:26:39-01:26:40): What do you need to.
Andrew (01:26:41-01:26:42): With those?
Bryan (01:26:43-01:26:46): Width, width, height, rail and style.
Bryan (01:26:46-01:26:47): Size.
Andrew (01:26:48-01:26:49): What size?
Andrew (01:26:49-01:26:50): Rail size.
Bryan (01:26:50-01:26:51): Rail and style.
Andrew (01:26:51-01:26:52): Rail and style.
Andrew (01:26:52-01:26:54): And what are you measuring on those though?
Bryan (01:26:54-01:26:54): Width.
Andrew (01:26:56-01:26:59): So we need the overall width and length.
Andrew (01:26:59-01:26:59): Yeah.
Bryan (01:26:59-01:27:03): And then you need the width of rail and styles.
Bryan (01:27:04-01:27:08): You have a 14 inch door with a two and a quarter rail and stain overlay.
Andrew (01:27:09-01:27:11): Is the rail ever different?
Bryan (01:27:12-01:27:12): Yes.
Andrew (01:27:13-01:27:15): From the top and the bottom pretty.
Bryan (01:27:15-01:27:16): Much just only on drawers.
Andrew (01:27:17-01:27:17): Okay.
Andrew (01:27:17-01:27:18): So you do need.
Bryan (01:27:19-01:27:20): What you need on doors.
Bryan (01:27:20-01:27:21): You don't need on doors.
Bryan (01:27:22-01:27:23): What you need on doors is check rail.
Andrew (01:27:24-01:27:24): Okay.
Bryan (01:27:24-01:27:26): And is there a check rail width?
Bryan (01:27:28-01:27:29): Okay, Is there a check rail?
Andrew (01:27:29-01:27:29): You set it up now.
Andrew (01:27:29-01:27:30): So I'll have that.
Bryan (01:27:30-01:27:37): What you need on drawers is top rail, bottom rail.
Bryan (01:27:37-01:27:39): And then your styles are probably gonna.
Bryan (01:27:39-01:27:40): Your styles will match your drawers.
Andrew (01:27:41-01:27:42): Okay.
Andrew (01:27:42-01:27:44): In terms of the.
Andrew (01:27:45-01:27:47): We missed it on the cabinet level too.
Andrew (01:27:48-01:27:51): What are the dimensional things we missed?
Bryan (01:27:52-01:27:54): Face frame widths.
Andrew (01:27:54-01:27:54): What else?
Andrew (01:27:54-01:27:55): The actual dimension.
Andrew (01:27:55-01:27:56): The box itself, too.
Bryan (01:27:57-01:27:58): Yeah.
Andrew (01:27:58-01:28:00): Overall height, overall width.
Andrew (01:28:00-01:28:01): Depth.
Bryan (01:28:03-01:28:07): Yeah, you need depth over, I guess overall height.
Bryan (01:28:07-01:28:08): Overall length is fine for.
Andrew (01:28:08-01:28:10): What about like, things like K height?
Andrew (01:28:11-01:28:12): Yeah, sure.
Andrew (01:28:12-01:28:12): Like what?
Andrew (01:28:12-01:28:14): No, what are the things you're overlooking that, like.
Bryan (01:28:15-01:28:16): Yeah, you could do K things that.
Andrew (01:28:16-01:28:18): If there are generic ones, that'll be automatic.
Andrew (01:28:18-01:28:20): But like, sometimes what things might have variation?
Bryan (01:28:20-01:28:22): Yeah, toe can have variation.
Bryan (01:28:23-01:28:24): Height can have variation.
Bryan (01:28:24-01:28:26): Depth can have variation openings.
Bryan (01:28:26-01:28:27): So you need your face frame dimensions.
Andrew (01:28:28-01:28:30): How do you record openings to the.
Andrew (01:28:30-01:28:31): To get a cut?
Andrew (01:28:32-01:28:33): Like, how do you.
Andrew (01:28:33-01:28:35): How do you say what the opening is?
Andrew (01:28:35-01:28:38): Like, what is the field that I would write that in?
Bryan (01:28:49-01:28:51): I would say at this spot, you.
Bryan (01:28:51-01:28:53): You pretty much just need overall height.
Andrew (01:28:54-01:28:56): Okay, so I'll give you an example.
Andrew (01:28:56-01:29:00): You told me to build you a base cabinet, and I have to build a face frame for this base cabinet.
Andrew (01:29:01-01:29:01): Okay.
Andrew (01:29:02-01:29:05): And to build a face frame for this base cabinet, what do I need to know?
Bryan (01:29:06-01:29:08): A lot more than just openings.
Andrew (01:29:08-01:29:10): What is it you need?
Bryan (01:29:10-01:29:15): You need to know Your face frame doesn't match your cabinet width.
Bryan (01:29:15-01:29:16): Okay.
Bryan (01:29:16-01:29:18): So your face frame is completely separate from your cabinet.
Andrew (01:29:18-01:29:20): So what is that difference and how do I know?
Bryan (01:29:20-01:29:21): The difference varies?
Bryan (01:29:21-01:29:22): It depends on the drawing.
Andrew (01:29:22-01:29:24): But just tell me about it.
Bryan (01:29:24-01:29:25): Is there a blind corner?
Bryan (01:29:25-01:29:25): Is there an.
Bryan (01:29:25-01:29:26): A blind corner?
Bryan (01:29:26-01:29:28): Is it an inside corner or is it not inside corner?
Bryan (01:29:28-01:29:29): Does it have scribe?
Bryan (01:29:29-01:29:31): Does it not have scribe?
Bryan (01:29:31-01:29:34): Where's your openings with the opening heights?
Bryan (01:29:34-01:29:35): Where your opening widths.
Andrew (01:29:36-01:29:37): But how do I know?
Andrew (01:29:38-01:29:46): So I'll look at the drawing that you sent me, and it's got this, and there's like a drawer opening at the top, and there's a door, a thing called a door.
Andrew (01:29:46-01:29:51): Okay, now what do I know?
Andrew (01:29:51-01:29:52): Need to know before I go and.
Bryan (01:29:52-01:29:56): Cut that face frame, what it's interacting with on the other side.
Andrew (01:29:56-01:29:57): Yeah.
Andrew (01:29:57-01:29:57): So I need to know.
Andrew (01:29:57-01:29:59): Okay, does I see a door?
Andrew (01:29:59-01:30:00): What kind of door is it?
Andrew (01:30:00-01:30:00): So you.
Andrew (01:30:00-01:30:01): No, no.
Bryan (01:30:01-01:30:02): You're saying the face frame.
Andrew (01:30:02-01:30:03): Yeah.
Bryan (01:30:03-01:30:05): So you need to know what the next cabinet Is.
Bryan (01:30:05-01:30:07): Or what it's going next to or.
Andrew (01:30:07-01:30:07): Oh, okay.
Andrew (01:30:08-01:30:08): Yeah.
Andrew (01:30:08-01:30:09): Because the face frame goes.
Bryan (01:30:09-01:30:09): So.
Andrew (01:30:10-01:30:14): So is a face frame connected to a cabinet run or a cabinet run?
Andrew (01:30:14-01:30:17): Okay, so face frames are on the cabinet run level.
Andrew (01:30:17-01:30:18): Cool.
Andrew (01:30:18-01:30:19): So that's something we need to know.
Andrew (01:30:19-01:30:25): So the cabinet is just a shell behind the face cabinet run.
Bryan (01:30:25-01:30:26): No, I'm sorry.
Bryan (01:30:26-01:30:26): It's on the cabinet level.
Andrew (01:30:27-01:30:29): Oh, it is on the cabinet level.
Andrew (01:30:29-01:30:31): So how do you separate this?
Andrew (01:30:32-01:30:35): Let's say there's a door and a drawer.
Andrew (01:30:35-01:30:35): And then this.
Andrew (01:30:35-01:30:38): There's the another one next to it.
Andrew (01:30:38-01:30:39): That is open shelves.
Andrew (01:30:40-01:30:43): Are you considering that's one cabinet?
Andrew (01:30:43-01:30:45): So then how do I call those sections?
Andrew (01:30:45-01:30:46): Oh, they call sections.
Andrew (01:30:47-01:30:49): So how many sections does a cabinet have?
Andrew (01:30:49-01:30:51): Is a question I would have.
Andrew (01:30:51-01:30:53): And then we determine each of those sections.
Andrew (01:30:54-01:30:57): The specs for it probably just open.
Andrew (01:31:01-01:31:02): No more to it.
Andrew (01:31:02-01:31:03): I've got it.
Andrew (01:31:03-01:31:04): I think you should call.
Bryan (01:31:04-01:31:05): I think that's a.
Bryan (01:31:05-01:31:06): Like a real cotton.
Bryan (01:31:06-01:31:07): The weed spot.
Andrew (01:31:07-01:31:07): No, that's.
Andrew (01:31:07-01:31:11): I need to work out how to put door like.
Andrew (01:31:11-01:31:16): This section here has this size opening has shelves in it.
Andrew (01:31:16-01:31:18): This section here has a drawer.
Andrew (01:31:18-01:31:21): And this section here has a cabinet with a door.
Andrew (01:31:21-01:31:22): There's sections.
Andrew (01:31:22-01:31:23): They're cabinet sections.
Andrew (01:31:25-01:31:28): So I'm just determining what's on going the category below a cabinet.
Andrew (01:31:29-01:31:31): Now, the reason I'm asking that I think.
Bryan (01:31:31-01:31:32): I think you would have cabinet.
Andrew (01:31:32-01:31:33): Yeah.
Bryan (01:31:33-01:31:34): And then you would have openings.
Bryan (01:31:35-01:31:37): And then just opening definition.
Bryan (01:31:38-01:31:39): Is it a drawer?
Andrew (01:31:41-01:31:42): Is it open?
Bryan (01:31:42-01:31:43): Shelving?
Andrew (01:31:43-01:31:47): And then let's say I have to make the face frame for this on the cabinet level.
Andrew (01:31:48-01:31:55): I'm trying to make sure that you have given those details so that face frame can be made without having to ask you.
Andrew (01:31:55-01:31:57): So what am I missing that you.
Bryan (01:31:57-01:32:00): Haven'T given me a lot of work like that.
Bryan (01:32:00-01:32:03): That is the point where you have to go into Rhino and get all your face frame dimensions.
Andrew (01:32:04-01:32:04): So what are those?
Andrew (01:32:05-01:32:06): Tell me those things.
Bryan (01:32:07-01:32:08): Your overall height.
Bryan (01:32:08-01:32:09): Yeah, your face frame height.
Bryan (01:32:10-01:32:12): What's happening on either side of the cabinet.
Andrew (01:32:12-01:32:13): Okay.
Andrew (01:32:13-01:32:15): And what's happening on either side of the cabinet?
Bryan (01:32:15-01:32:17): Tell me about that wall scribe appliance return.
Bryan (01:32:18-01:32:18): Inside corner.
Andrew (01:32:18-01:32:19): Okay, cool.
Andrew (01:32:19-01:32:20): Yep.
Andrew (01:32:20-01:32:20): What else is that?
Bryan (01:32:23-01:32:23): Your openings.
Andrew (01:32:23-01:32:24): Yep.
Bryan (01:32:24-01:32:25): All your defined openings.
Bryan (01:32:25-01:32:26): Height and width.
Andrew (01:32:27-01:32:28): Thickness.
Andrew (01:32:28-01:32:32): Is the opening different to where the face frame comes down to?
Andrew (01:32:32-01:32:33): Because that happens a lot.
Andrew (01:32:33-01:32:40): So the actual whole opening on the face frame is different to the actual inside every time.
Andrew (01:32:40-01:32:41): It is.
Andrew (01:32:41-01:32:44): So like, how do I know what size my face frame?
Andrew (01:32:45-01:32:46): The actual hole?
Bryan (01:32:47-01:32:48): So that's what we're defining.
Andrew (01:32:48-01:32:49): Okay.
Bryan (01:32:49-01:32:50): But like A length and width.
Andrew (01:32:51-01:32:52): Yeah, but, like, how do.
Andrew (01:32:53-01:32:55): So what's the field name for that?
Andrew (01:32:56-01:32:57): Let's say my job is.
Andrew (01:32:57-01:32:59): I'm tasked with just cutting the face frame.
Andrew (01:33:00-01:33:01): What do I need?
Andrew (01:33:01-01:33:03): Like, how do I know where and how to cut it?
Bryan (01:33:04-01:33:05): I think we're circling the drain.
Andrew (01:33:05-01:33:07): Yeah, we're talking about the same thing.
Bryan (01:33:10-01:33:11): This is what you need.
Andrew (01:33:13-01:33:16): I just need you to say out loud what the actual dimension is.
Andrew (01:33:16-01:33:21): I am like, the type of dimension, not the actual number, but like, hey.
Bryan (01:33:21-01:33:22): It'S a length and a width.
Bryan (01:33:23-01:33:24): It's a height and a width.
Andrew (01:33:28-01:33:31): Just show me that we're talking about the same thing.
Andrew (01:33:31-01:33:32): I think just a little.
Bryan (01:33:37-01:33:38): This is an example where it's.
Bryan (01:33:38-01:33:39): It's not that simple.
Bryan (01:33:40-01:33:44): Because being in a trade for a long time, you already know how to build a face frame.
Bryan (01:33:44-01:33:45): It's not.
Andrew (01:33:45-01:33:47): I get you, I get you.
Andrew (01:33:47-01:33:49): But, like, I'm trying to get you to have.
Andrew (01:33:49-01:33:51): As before, you talk to a person.
Bryan (01:33:51-01:33:51): Bath.
Bryan (01:33:53-01:33:54): You have your height.
Andrew (01:33:55-01:33:57): Yeah, that's the whole cabinet.
Bryan (01:33:57-01:33:58): You have your opening overall.
Andrew (01:33:59-01:33:59): Yeah.
Bryan (01:33:59-01:34:00): You have individual openings.
Bryan (01:34:01-01:34:02): You have opening width.
Andrew (01:34:05-01:34:06): Okay.
Andrew (01:34:06-01:34:06): And.
Andrew (01:34:07-01:34:08): Okay, let me give you this.
Andrew (01:34:09-01:34:12): So this is the overall height, not of the face frame or of the cabinet.
Bryan (01:34:12-01:34:13): In this case.
Bryan (01:34:13-01:34:14): No face frame.
Andrew (01:34:14-01:34:15): So this is the face frame.
Andrew (01:34:15-01:34:19): This is the overall cap cabinet with countertop, with count.
Andrew (01:34:19-01:34:21): This one here, like, 42.
Andrew (01:34:22-01:34:22): Yeah.
Andrew (01:34:22-01:34:22): Right.
Andrew (01:34:23-01:34:26): So I need to make the face frame.
Andrew (01:34:26-01:34:29): I need to know that I'm cutting 41 by 57, 9, 16.
Andrew (01:34:30-01:34:33): That's my first thing that I'm technically making.
Andrew (01:34:33-01:34:35): If it's one solid piece, it's never.
Andrew (01:34:36-01:34:37): I'm just.
Andrew (01:34:37-01:34:41): I'm just hypothetically right now, just so it's easy to understand, because, like.
Andrew (01:34:41-01:34:44): And then I need to know individual openings.
Andrew (01:34:45-01:34:46): So that's a measurement.
Andrew (01:34:46-01:34:46): I'm.
Andrew (01:34:46-01:34:47): So there's height and width.
Andrew (01:34:47-01:34:48): How many openings are there?
Andrew (01:34:49-01:34:50): And then height and width.
Andrew (01:34:51-01:34:52): What else am I missing?
Bryan (01:34:53-01:34:54): Scribe.
Bryan (01:34:54-01:34:54): Scribe.
Bryan (01:34:54-01:34:55): Okay, return.
Andrew (01:34:56-01:34:59): So tell me what that those actual names would be.
Andrew (01:34:59-01:34:59): Scribe.
Andrew (01:34:59-01:35:00): Width, Scribe.
Andrew (01:35:00-01:35:01): Height, Scribe.
Andrew (01:35:01-01:35:02): Position, Scribe.
Andrew (01:35:02-01:35:02): What?
Andrew (01:35:03-01:35:04): That's all I need.
Andrew (01:35:04-01:35:05): I don't need to know the data.
Andrew (01:35:05-01:35:07): I just need to know the fields that you would put a number in.
Bryan (01:35:07-01:35:09): So that it's just scribe, yes or no.
Andrew (01:35:10-01:35:11): Okay.
Andrew (01:35:11-01:35:14): And then things like, is there anything else?
Andrew (01:35:14-01:35:23): So what I've seen is overall height, overall width of face internal sections, how many there are, and then their length and width.
Bryan (01:35:25-01:35:27): This is not a number a face frame person needs.
Andrew (01:35:29-01:35:30): What is that number?
Bryan (01:35:30-01:35:31): It's the overall.
Bryan (01:35:31-01:35:34): He needs this inside because your face frame, he has to know how to hold.
Andrew (01:35:34-01:35:34): Cool.
Andrew (01:35:34-01:35:37): So that'll be in the capital section.
Andrew (01:35:37-01:35:39): But face frame will have what's the overall inside.
Bryan (01:35:40-01:35:40): Exactly.
Andrew (01:35:41-01:35:42): So which is.
Andrew (01:35:42-01:35:44): That's all I need to know from you.
Andrew (01:35:44-01:35:50): It's like overall face frame height and width is different from overall cabinet height and width, which is a number.
Andrew (01:35:50-01:35:52): I just need to give you the feel so you can type it in.
Andrew (01:35:54-01:35:56): I'm just asking you for the feel that you want.
Bryan (01:35:57-01:35:57): Okay.
Bryan (01:35:57-01:36:01): So I don't know if we need to go this route.
Bryan (01:36:02-01:36:07): I see the detail that's like really leading to the production of a materials.
Andrew (01:36:07-01:36:07): List.
Bryan (01:36:10-01:36:18): But this is not making things simpler, and it's not even making it to a point that it can be handed off to someone who's never done it.
Bryan (01:36:21-01:36:26): That information is too confusing to somebody who's going to come and build the thing at the end.
Andrew (01:36:26-01:36:29): Okay, so I'll walk you through what's in my mind.
Andrew (01:36:29-01:36:38): You just punched the hole in it is that when you get down to you, are you going to do these sections first before you design the face frame?
Bryan (01:36:39-01:36:42): Am I going to do the section views, not sections.
Andrew (01:36:42-01:36:43): I'll reword that.
Andrew (01:36:43-01:36:47): Are you going to do the openings first before you do the face frame?
Andrew (01:36:47-01:36:51): Am I going to do the design out the openings like in this one?
Andrew (01:36:52-01:36:53): Like, let's say we're building the cabinet.
Andrew (01:36:53-01:36:55): Just ignore face frame for now.
Andrew (01:36:55-01:37:03): Are you going to do the floors, doors, and shelving inside a cabinet before you go and spec out a face frame?
Bryan (01:37:04-01:37:05): You're talking just like on the production floor.
Bryan (01:37:06-01:37:06): The guys are good.
Bryan (01:37:06-01:37:08): They have these three phases.
Bryan (01:37:08-01:37:10): They have the drawer faces, the face frame, and the cabinet.
Bryan (01:37:10-01:37:11): Which are they doing first?
Bryan (01:37:11-01:37:12): Doesn't matter.
Andrew (01:37:12-01:37:15): No, I mean in design phase.
Bryan (01:37:15-01:37:17): In the design phase, when you're drawing.
Andrew (01:37:17-01:37:20): A box, you draw a box, and then what do you draw?
Bryan (01:37:21-01:37:23): My openings are.
Bryan (01:37:23-01:37:24): I draw the wall.
Bryan (01:37:25-01:37:34): Then I draw plumbing center lines, window center lines, doors, and then I center openings to reflect, like a symmetry.
Andrew (01:37:34-01:37:35): That's cool.
Andrew (01:37:35-01:37:43): And then once you've done that, how do you drawers and stuff in right now?
Andrew (01:37:43-01:37:44): Yeah, because it's just.
Andrew (01:37:44-01:37:48): Drawers are just really just where the holes are going, the box goes in.
Andrew (01:37:48-01:37:50): But let's say it's like you're building an inbuilt fixed shelf.
Bryan (01:37:51-01:37:53): An inbuilt fixed shelf?
Andrew (01:37:53-01:37:54): Yeah, like into the box itself.
Andrew (01:37:54-01:37:56): Okay, so how.
Andrew (01:37:56-01:38:01): When are you doing that versus when are you drawing, like, the face frame?
Andrew (01:38:02-01:38:03): Like, do you have to have.
Bryan (01:38:03-01:38:04): Face frames are first.
Andrew (01:38:04-01:38:05): Face frames are first.
Bryan (01:38:05-01:38:06): Face frames are first.
Andrew (01:38:07-01:38:08): Why face frames first?
Bryan (01:38:08-01:38:10): Because you have to get all those openings.
Bryan (01:38:10-01:38:10): Right.
Andrew (01:38:10-01:38:11): So that the wall looks good.
Bryan (01:38:12-01:38:13): Also.
Andrew (01:38:13-01:38:15): You're drawing like the overall, like, picture facade.
Andrew (01:38:15-01:38:16): Yeah.
Andrew (01:38:16-01:38:17): And then you're building the shell afterwards.
Andrew (01:38:24-01:38:26): How does that work from a planning it out point of view?
Andrew (01:38:27-01:38:27): Hold on.
Andrew (01:38:30-01:38:33): You're actually drawing the cabinet itself first.
Andrew (01:38:34-01:38:36): The actual empty shelves with no filling.
Andrew (01:38:36-01:38:45): And then you're drawing a face frame, and then you're drawing all the stuff inside because you need the actual cabinet as well before you can draw a face frame.
Bryan (01:38:46-01:38:54): No, now I'm going into a room, and if there's casing here, this phase frame is going to be two and three quarter wide instead of an inch and three quarter wide.
Bryan (01:38:54-01:38:55): This is my center line.
Bryan (01:38:55-01:38:59): So these openings are going to get divided into two, and they're 18 and 7, 8 each.
Bryan (01:38:59-01:39:00): I'm doing all my openings first.
Andrew (01:39:01-01:39:03): Right, so you're not doing face frame first.
Bryan (01:39:03-01:39:04): It is my face frame.
Bryan (01:39:04-01:39:05): All my openings are on my face frame.
Andrew (01:39:09-01:39:13): Because I just want to make sure the uppercut.
Andrew (01:39:14-01:39:21): Look, if I am building, I'm coming in and I'm looking at a run.
Andrew (01:39:23-01:39:23): Okay.
Andrew (01:39:23-01:39:26): And this has that one that.
Andrew (01:39:26-01:39:27): The sink here.
Bryan (01:39:28-01:39:30): And then I've got some drawers here.
Andrew (01:39:30-01:39:31): And this is a dishwasher.
Andrew (01:39:33-01:39:35): Okay, we're looking at that.
Bryan (01:39:35-01:39:36): What are you looking at?
Bryan (01:39:36-01:39:39): Are you looking at a homeowner who's asking for this?
Andrew (01:39:39-01:39:40): No, I'm asking to build.
Andrew (01:39:41-01:39:42): We're looking from a builder.
Bryan (01:39:42-01:39:43): So it's already drawn.
Andrew (01:39:43-01:39:43): Yeah.
Andrew (01:39:43-01:39:45): So this is the drawing that's already drawn.
Andrew (01:39:46-01:39:46): Okay.
Andrew (01:39:46-01:39:53): We've got a door, a drawer, dishwasher, sink, and then.
Bryan (01:39:56-01:39:57): Okay.
Andrew (01:39:57-01:39:57): Okay.
Andrew (01:39:58-01:39:59): Are you.
Andrew (01:39:59-01:39:59): Are you.
Andrew (01:39:59-01:40:01): Are you drawing?
Andrew (01:40:02-01:40:03): So how many cabinets first?
Andrew (01:40:03-01:40:06): Two, which are split bare at the dishwasher.
Andrew (01:40:07-01:40:11): So it's this and then this dishwasher excluded.
Andrew (01:40:12-01:40:13): Oh, so you're doing this.
Bryan (01:40:13-01:40:13): Yeah.
Andrew (01:40:13-01:40:14): So it's technically three.
Andrew (01:40:14-01:40:16): Because you have a panel to build.
Bryan (01:40:16-01:40:17): Here too, if it's a panel.
Andrew (01:40:17-01:40:17): Yeah.
Andrew (01:40:17-01:40:18): So.
Andrew (01:40:18-01:40:19): So one.
Andrew (01:40:19-01:40:22): So base one, base two, base three.
Andrew (01:40:23-01:40:28): Okay, now when you're doing the face frame, is it a face frame for the.
Andrew (01:40:28-01:40:30): Are you doing a face frame for this?
Bryan (01:40:30-01:40:31): Yep.
Andrew (01:40:31-01:40:32): A face frame for this?
Bryan (01:40:32-01:40:33): Yep.
Andrew (01:40:34-01:40:35): Okay, so when you're.
Andrew (01:40:35-01:40:37): So from this point, what are we.
Andrew (01:40:37-01:40:37): What are we doing?
Andrew (01:40:37-01:40:41): We're not doing this as your first drawing of cabinet.
Bryan (01:40:43-01:40:44): Huh?
Andrew (01:40:44-01:40:46): Like, see how this is.
Andrew (01:40:46-01:40:48): The box itself needs dimension.
Bryan (01:40:48-01:40:50): This is what I inherit.
Bryan (01:40:53-01:40:57): I inherit this exact drawing.
Andrew (01:40:58-01:41:00): Okay, and what are you.
Andrew (01:41:00-01:41:01): What are you going to do?
Bryan (01:41:01-01:41:03): We're going to draw section views.
Andrew (01:41:03-01:41:05): Okay, so what's the section?
Andrew (01:41:05-01:41:14): The section view is basically you're taking this and you're exploding it out into this and then this is the side, and then this is the front.
Andrew (01:41:15-01:41:15): Right.
Bryan (01:41:15-01:41:16): This is my section.
Bryan (01:41:16-01:41:21): Views section, end panel section, internal section.
Andrew (01:41:24-01:41:25): In panel section.
Andrew (01:41:25-01:41:27): So you're doing the side and then you're doing.
Bryan (01:41:27-01:41:30): Okay, talk to me about this in X ray view.
Bryan (01:41:30-01:41:30): A cutout.
Andrew (01:41:30-01:41:33): Yeah, but what does that mean for me?
Andrew (01:41:33-01:41:34): What am I looking at?
Bryan (01:41:34-01:41:36): The interior of the cabinet.
Andrew (01:41:36-01:41:36): Yeah, no, I got that.
Andrew (01:41:36-01:41:37): But like, what is this?
Andrew (01:41:37-01:41:38): What is this?
Andrew (01:41:38-01:41:38): What is this?
Bryan (01:41:38-01:41:40): Drawer, drawer, drawer.
Andrew (01:41:40-01:41:41): But you're drawing the drawer.
Andrew (01:41:41-01:41:43): But we're not making the drawer.
Bryan (01:41:43-01:41:43): Nope.
Bryan (01:41:43-01:41:44): It's just visual reference.
Andrew (01:41:45-01:41:48): So from a technical point of view, how.
Andrew (01:41:48-01:41:49): Like, that's what I'm saying to you.
Andrew (01:41:49-01:41:49): So.
Bryan (01:41:49-01:41:56): But I need to draw the drawers for a personal job if I'm gonna order them because I need to know that they're gonna fit.
Andrew (01:41:56-01:42:02): So from specifications, this here, I need the.
Andrew (01:42:03-01:42:04): Cause your face frame is here.
Andrew (01:42:04-01:42:08): Let's say that's your face frame and that's your box right here.
Bryan (01:42:08-01:42:08): Yep.
Bryan (01:42:08-01:42:08): Face frame.
Andrew (01:42:08-01:42:09): Right.
Andrew (01:42:09-01:42:11): So your face frame.
Andrew (01:42:13-01:42:15): Are you not going to give me the.
Andrew (01:42:15-01:42:15): The.
Andrew (01:42:16-01:42:19): The XY of this first?
Bryan (01:42:24-01:42:25): I don't think it matters.
Andrew (01:42:27-01:42:27): It.
Bryan (01:42:29-01:42:31): I think what I'm doing now is I'm doing what's.
Bryan (01:42:31-01:42:35): If I need to do plywood parts first, I'll do all that first.
Andrew (01:42:35-01:42:35): I'm.
Andrew (01:42:35-01:42:37): I'm asking from the.
Andrew (01:42:37-01:42:38): From the spec level.
Andrew (01:42:38-01:42:43): Like, if I'm coming in and I open the cabinet page, new cabinet spec.
Bryan (01:42:47-01:42:50): This might be why it's better to beta test 2 so I can actually see it.
Andrew (01:42:50-01:42:52): No, no, I get it.
Andrew (01:42:52-01:42:56): But what is the first thing you want to see when you hit new cabinet?
Andrew (01:42:58-01:42:59): I'll just ask you, what do you want to see?
Bryan (01:42:59-01:43:02): Like, at this point, we've said that this is cabinet B3.
Bryan (01:43:02-01:43:03): What do I want to see next?
Andrew (01:43:03-01:43:03): Yes.
Andrew (01:43:03-01:43:04): So now you.
Andrew (01:43:05-01:43:08): You're starting the drawing on B3, and you've hit new.
Andrew (01:43:09-01:43:11): So what is the spec file look like to you?
Andrew (01:43:14-01:43:17): So you can add openings, number of drawers.
Andrew (01:43:17-01:43:19): So that's add openings.
Andrew (01:43:19-01:43:22): Okay, so there are three openings.
Bryan (01:43:22-01:43:22): Yeah.
Andrew (01:43:22-01:43:23): What else?
Bryan (01:43:23-01:43:24): There's seven.
Andrew (01:43:25-01:43:26): Oh, yeah.
Andrew (01:43:26-01:43:26): Seven.
Andrew (01:43:27-01:43:28): Seven.
Bryan (01:43:28-01:43:28): Okay.
Bryan (01:43:28-01:43:29): Or six.
Bryan (01:43:29-01:43:29): Sorry.
Andrew (01:43:30-01:43:30): So you're adding.
Andrew (01:43:31-01:43:33): Now you have to spec these seven, six openings.
Andrew (01:43:34-01:43:36): So do you want to define.
Andrew (01:43:36-01:43:39): Do you want to work in a linear way where you're like, these are.
Andrew (01:43:40-01:43:41): This is drawer one, and I'm a spec.
Andrew (01:43:41-01:43:42): All of drawer one.
Andrew (01:43:42-01:43:45): Or do you want to say there are six openings and then work through.
Bryan (01:43:45-01:43:51): Them the first way where this is drawer one, standard.
Bryan (01:43:51-01:43:52): Drawer two, standard.
Bryan (01:43:52-01:43:56): Drawer three, trash pullout, drawer four, cutlery inside.
Andrew (01:43:57-01:43:57): Okay.
Bryan (01:43:57-01:43:58): So.
Andrew (01:43:58-01:44:02): But also, what else do I need to know apart from the openings?
Andrew (01:44:02-01:44:04): You're missing the global part.
Andrew (01:44:04-01:44:05): Like new cabinet.
Andrew (01:44:06-01:44:09): What does a blind person need to know about new cabinet?
Bryan (01:44:10-01:44:11): I thought we already did that.
Andrew (01:44:11-01:44:14): Yeah, but that's what I'm saying to you because you're contradicting me with your.
Andrew (01:44:15-01:44:19): So I need to know face frame, what are the other categories?
Andrew (01:44:21-01:44:24): So we have overall length and width and depth.
Andrew (01:44:26-01:44:31): And then we have face frame length, width, and that's inside face frame spec.
Andrew (01:44:31-01:44:33): But what are the other spec categories?
Bryan (01:44:33-01:44:38): So this you could get a length and a width and a depth on, but you cannot build off of it.
Andrew (01:44:41-01:44:42): Why not?
Bryan (01:44:42-01:44:44): Because you don't know how they're all laid out.
Bryan (01:44:44-01:44:45): You don't know what it looks like.
Andrew (01:44:48-01:44:48): Right.
Andrew (01:44:48-01:44:49): You have a picture connected to.
Bryan (01:44:50-01:44:50): I get that.
Andrew (01:44:50-01:44:57): But what I'm saying is, like, you do need to know the face frame, this stuff.
Andrew (01:44:57-01:45:00): You need to know how wide am I cutting the face frame?
Andrew (01:45:00-01:45:03): Like on the floor to minimize friction.
Andrew (01:45:03-01:45:07): If I'm told my face frame is this length and this width, I'm gonna cut that.
Andrew (01:45:11-01:45:12): But why is that?
Andrew (01:45:12-01:45:13): Is it relevant?
Andrew (01:45:13-01:45:14): Is it not relevant?
Bryan (01:45:15-01:45:16): It's too simplified.
Bryan (01:45:16-01:45:17): It's not the way it is.
Andrew (01:45:17-01:45:18): So how do I.
Andrew (01:45:18-01:45:25): How do we do it in a way that it is the way that, like, I need to have the feels that you would check with your eyes.
Bryan (01:45:25-01:45:29): All we need for them is make the face frame and a dimension drawing.
Bryan (01:45:30-01:45:31): So is there a face frame?
Andrew (01:45:31-01:45:32): Yes.
Andrew (01:45:33-01:45:33): Okay.
Bryan (01:45:33-01:45:35): Build the face frame is the task that comes out of it.
Bryan (01:45:36-01:45:38): Dimension drawing, however, gets produced later when.
Andrew (01:45:38-01:45:40): They come back and ask you questions.
Andrew (01:45:40-01:45:42): What are the common questions they ask?
Bryan (01:45:42-01:45:44): It's a dimension that I forgot to pull.
Andrew (01:45:46-01:45:47): So those are the things I need right now.
Andrew (01:45:48-01:45:49): So what are those things that I get?
Andrew (01:45:50-01:45:51): I have to get you to have.
Andrew (01:45:52-01:45:53): You must have.
Bryan (01:45:54-01:45:55): They're not universal.
Bryan (01:45:56-01:45:59): And the reason is phase frames aren't universal.
Bryan (01:45:59-01:46:06): Like, these are really simple ones, but if you get into a more complicated.
Bryan (01:46:07-01:46:08): Let's Maybe pulp is.
Bryan (01:46:08-01:46:10): Yeah, pulp is a good example.
Bryan (01:46:11-01:46:12): You don't have here.
Bryan (01:46:17-01:46:19): Consistent like this.
Bryan (01:46:19-01:46:21): This is nice.
Bryan (01:46:21-01:46:29): You could easily tell them an overall height and overall interior width, overall interior lower height, overall interior upper height.
Andrew (01:46:29-01:46:31): I don't need that.
Andrew (01:46:31-01:46:38): I need you to give me the three fields that you want to be able to tell them without having to tell them.
Andrew (01:46:38-01:46:40): I'm not asking for a universal word for everything.
Andrew (01:46:40-01:46:45): I'm asking for the fields that you would want to tell them in any way that you want.
Bryan (01:46:45-01:46:47): It would just be face frame.
Bryan (01:46:47-01:46:47): Yes or no?
Andrew (01:46:47-01:46:48): Yeah.
Bryan (01:46:49-01:46:52): Material of the face frame and style.
Bryan (01:46:53-01:46:57): Is it beaded, is it flat, is it European?
Andrew (01:46:58-01:46:58): Yeah.
Andrew (01:46:58-01:47:02): But then if they were to go and do it and you weren't available, how would they do it?
Bryan (01:47:03-01:47:05): That gives them the information they need.
Andrew (01:47:07-01:47:09): Okay, so this one's a simple one.
Andrew (01:47:09-01:47:11): You just told me universal height, universal width.
Andrew (01:47:11-01:47:13): Hey, there's an opening.
Andrew (01:47:13-01:47:15): What's the distance between that and that?
Andrew (01:47:16-01:47:16): Right.
Andrew (01:47:16-01:47:17): Like internal.
Andrew (01:47:17-01:47:18): So you can be like.
Andrew (01:47:18-01:47:20): Okay, so let's say this one here.
Andrew (01:47:20-01:47:22): What's the face frame look like?
Bryan (01:47:23-01:47:27): This comes down side across the board, bottom up across here, and there's like.
Andrew (01:47:27-01:47:29): There'S this stick coming up.
Andrew (01:47:29-01:47:30): Yes.
Andrew (01:47:31-01:47:35): So how would they go about doing this and what would they need to do it?
Bryan (01:47:36-01:47:37): Right now?
Bryan (01:47:37-01:47:39): They need to know to make a face frame.
Andrew (01:47:39-01:47:39): Yeah.
Bryan (01:47:40-01:47:41): And then they just need this picture.
Andrew (01:47:43-01:47:45): How do they know the width of this?
Bryan (01:47:46-01:47:50): I have pulled it here because it has to be wider for a cutout.
Andrew (01:47:50-01:47:56): So, will, why can't I have this ready to go for them every time?
Bryan (01:47:58-01:48:00): Every single one's unique.
Andrew (01:48:00-01:48:03): No, I mean like as in when you're drawing it, are you always drawing it this way?
Andrew (01:48:04-01:48:07): Are you making sure that everything is labeled?
Bryan (01:48:08-01:48:08): Yeah.
Andrew (01:48:11-01:48:17): So that's all I really needed because I don't need you to write two and a half down in here.
Andrew (01:48:18-01:48:23): I just need to make sure that we dotted our I's, crossed our T's.
Andrew (01:48:23-01:48:26): That for every face frame, it has all the specs that someone would need.
Andrew (01:48:27-01:48:28): How do I make sure that happens?
Bryan (01:48:29-01:48:42): So maybe the better thing to do at this juncture, which would lead right to a job card anyway, is for me to pull all these dimensions, make the printable PDF and upload it.
Bryan (01:48:42-01:48:43): And have a spot for an upload?
Andrew (01:48:44-01:48:44): Yes, Correct.
Andrew (01:48:44-01:48:46): So the base range needs a PDF upload.
Bryan (01:48:46-01:48:47): Yeah.
Andrew (01:48:47-01:48:48): Okay, cool.
Bryan (01:48:48-01:48:49): That is the simplest.
Andrew (01:48:49-01:48:50): Okay, that's easy.
Andrew (01:48:52-01:48:54): Do you want to go get lunch?
Andrew (01:48:56-01:48:57): The perfect place is down the street.
Bryan (01:48:57-01:48:57): Just.
Andrew (01:48:57-01:48:59): Just go out there and grab it.
Andrew (01:48:59-01:49:02): If you grab me something to anything, they're good as long as it doesn't have avocado in it and.
Bryan (01:49:02-01:49:04): Yeah, extra avocado.
Bryan (01:49:04-01:49:05): Extra beef?
Andrew (01:49:05-01:49:05): Yeah.
Bryan (01:49:05-01:49:06): Extra avocado.
Andrew (01:49:06-01:49:07): Yeah.
Andrew (01:49:08-01:49:08): It's literally.
Andrew (01:49:08-01:49:09): It's down the street.
Andrew (01:49:09-01:49:10): You eaten already?
Andrew (01:49:10-01:49:13): Yeah, yeah, just grab me that.
Andrew (01:49:13-01:49:14): How'd you go shooting stuff?
Andrew (01:49:14-01:49:15): Did you get a bunch of stuff?
Andrew (01:49:15-01:49:15): Yeah.
Andrew (01:49:17-01:49:17): Easy enough.
Andrew (01:49:17-01:49:18): All right, do that.
Andrew (01:49:19-01:49:21): I'll probably be through a lot by the time you get back.
Andrew (01:49:22-01:49:22): All right, sweet.
Bryan (01:49:22-01:49:23): Thanks, bro.
Bryan (01:49:24-01:49:25): Thank you.
Andrew (01:49:28-01:49:29): Ok, so back to.
Bryan (01:49:31-01:49:32): I like that idea.
Bryan (01:49:32-01:49:36): I like to have this database at this point and then to upload A PDF?
Bryan (01:49:36-01:49:38): Yeah, I think that's a really good way.
Bryan (01:49:39-01:49:41): I see that as a solution for.
Andrew (01:49:41-01:49:41): A lot of things.
Andrew (01:49:41-01:49:44): Yeah, that's already there.
Andrew (01:49:44-01:49:48): I just needed to understand was there any kind of figures that I need to pull out?
Bryan (01:49:52-01:49:59): I think the information that you're getting at this juncture with that tool for linear footage is more associated with money.
Andrew (01:50:00-01:50:01): No, I'm thinking from.
Andrew (01:50:01-01:50:05): From a point of view of, like, if I'm cutting a door, let's say.
Andrew (01:50:05-01:50:09): Let's say we can't see and see, and I'm cutting a door, I need to know about the door.
Bryan (01:50:10-01:50:11): I need to do the same thing.
Bryan (01:50:11-01:50:15): Then I need to have a PDF upload for that cabinet.
Bryan (01:50:15-01:50:21): Because what I do is I do this layer here and I do all my door dimensions and I put them on here.
Bryan (01:50:22-01:50:23): So it'd be like.
Andrew (01:50:23-01:50:26): It reinforces my point that each cabinet really should have its own rhino.
Andrew (01:50:30-01:50:35): Like, from a practical point of view, that's what makes the most logical sense.
Andrew (01:50:37-01:50:41): Because you would isolate yours, you would isolate all the other things from it.
Andrew (01:50:43-01:50:45): Or at worst, why can't you write.
Bryan (01:50:45-01:50:53): A script where maybe, like, we have a template that has a label up here and then it can identify that within this frame is.
Bryan (01:50:53-01:50:55): And then it can all be in one spot.
Andrew (01:50:57-01:51:00): Yeah, Let me get what you're saying.
Bryan (01:51:00-01:51:05): Layer all these in here as a room number, a cabinet number or something.
Bryan (01:51:07-01:51:07): Okay.
Andrew (01:51:08-01:51:10): No, yeah, I'll think through that.
Andrew (01:51:10-01:51:17): Okay, so back to specs doors we've done right drawers, what are the draw things that you would fill in?
Andrew (01:51:17-01:51:18): Imagine you're doing draws.
Andrew (01:51:18-01:51:24): And what are the of types team or anyone needs to know, including material sourcing, including production.
Andrew (01:51:24-01:51:28): What notes, what explanations need to be written down.
Bryan (01:51:28-01:51:32): If we do drawers, we need to know if it's what it's made of.
Bryan (01:51:33-01:51:39): It needs to be either birch plowed or maple, whether or not it gets a logo burned in.
Andrew (01:51:39-01:51:41): So type burn logo.
Andrew (01:51:41-01:51:42): Okay.
Bryan (01:51:43-01:51:44): You choose sizes.
Andrew (01:51:45-01:51:46): What do you mean by size?
Bryan (01:51:46-01:51:48): Because for drawers, we don't make them, we order them.
Bryan (01:51:48-01:51:51): So this is going down a different path to purchasing.
Bryan (01:51:52-01:52:03): So, like for this one here, and it could be drawn this way, but Blum is 5:16 offset from the size of your opening every single time, either side.
Andrew (01:52:04-01:52:07): So is that connected to hardware?
Bryan (01:52:07-01:52:09): Yes, it is connected to hardware.
Bryan (01:52:10-01:52:11): So, you know, depth.
Bryan (01:52:11-01:52:12): Depth tells you hardware because it's blunt.
Bryan (01:52:12-01:52:18): And our standard, like we did at the beginning, is Blum 563H slides.
Andrew (01:52:18-01:52:24): Okay, so what I'm hearing is certain hardware determines specifications.
Bryan (01:52:25-01:52:26): Okay.
Bryan (01:52:26-01:52:26): Yes.
Andrew (01:52:27-01:52:29): So if attached to a certain Blum piece of hardware.
Andrew (01:52:31-01:52:34): What are the things that the Blum hardware affects?
Bryan (01:52:35-01:52:36): What are the things the Blum hardware effects?
Andrew (01:52:37-01:52:38): So let's say that.
Andrew (01:52:38-01:52:39): I'll give you an example.
Andrew (01:52:39-01:52:40): This is really cool.
Andrew (01:52:40-01:52:47): So we know that Blum hardware is this thick, which means you can't make a drawer.
Andrew (01:52:47-01:52:53): The drawer has to be thinner based on the overall opening space because the hardware is so like that thick.
Andrew (01:52:53-01:53:02): So I would add to the hardware a minus 0.6 of an inch spec.
Andrew (01:53:02-01:53:07): So if you select that hardware it tells you hey, or in order to duct, that's how it would work.
Andrew (01:53:09-01:53:09): Okay.
Andrew (01:53:11-01:53:11): Okay.
Bryan (01:53:12-01:53:27): So that won't always work because if you have a face frame cabinet here that goes to a European style cabinet and your drawer face, your opening is going to be different and your drawer is offset and you could have two drawers that land on the same divider so that math will be different.
Andrew (01:53:27-01:53:35): So I don't need to know that the map so much as I need to know the field name that you would use to explain that offset.
Andrew (01:53:35-01:53:36): For example.
Bryan (01:53:39-01:53:41): What I need to know for drawers is the type.
Andrew (01:53:41-01:53:42): Yeah.
Bryan (01:53:42-01:53:43): And the size.
Andrew (01:53:46-01:53:47): Yeah, I get that.
Bryan (01:53:47-01:53:48): And what we can.
Andrew (01:53:52-01:53:52): Yeah.
Bryan (01:53:53-01:53:54): And the hardware type.
Bryan (01:53:56-01:53:57): Let's put it there for now.
Andrew (01:53:58-01:53:59): The reason I'm asking is this.
Andrew (01:54:00-01:54:03): If I am, let's say that.
Andrew (01:54:03-01:54:05): Are you always building a drawer?
Bryan (01:54:05-01:54:06): We don't build them.
Andrew (01:54:06-01:54:10): I'm just saying in general, this is just a carpentry question.
Andrew (01:54:10-01:54:16): Are you building a drawer to its maximum capacity like you trying to use the best out of the space?
Bryan (01:54:16-01:54:17): Oh, no.
Bryan (01:54:18-01:54:22): The hardware is specific for the depth because it's an undermount and it hooks on the back.
Bryan (01:54:22-01:54:23): It has to be a certain.
Andrew (01:54:24-01:54:26): Like imagine we didn't need hardware at all.
Andrew (01:54:26-01:54:30): An ideal drawer is just a thing that comes in and out.
Andrew (01:54:30-01:54:30): Right.
Andrew (01:54:30-01:54:32): Ignore hardware for a second.
Andrew (01:54:32-01:54:33): So that's what we're doing.
Andrew (01:54:33-01:54:42): But to have a drawer come in and out, we require hardware and hardware has specifications requirements for how much it takes.
Andrew (01:54:42-01:54:46): Now the hardware, which is really great, all the block hardware comes with its.
Andrew (01:54:46-01:54:47): All the details for it.
Andrew (01:54:47-01:54:51): Like the actual, when you go to the site has all this stuff for it.
Andrew (01:54:52-01:55:00): Now what would be amazing is to already know what the draw width should be based on the hardware.
Andrew (01:55:00-01:55:03): Because you're always trying to maximize like the hardware will sit there.
Andrew (01:55:03-01:55:09): You're going to know that the drawer, because of the opening of the internals, you know that drawer is going to be that.
Andrew (01:55:09-01:55:10): That's.
Andrew (01:55:10-01:55:12): Is that an assumption that is fair to make?
Bryan (01:55:13-01:55:13): Yes.
Andrew (01:55:14-01:55:18): Is there a scenario when it is not that.
Andrew (01:55:19-01:55:20): No.
Bryan (01:55:20-01:55:21): I think if you go off that.
Bryan (01:55:21-01:55:26): If you go off your opening your cabinet opening, not your face frame opening, your cabinet opening.
Bryan (01:55:26-01:55:26): Correct.
Bryan (01:55:26-01:55:27): And you'll get it every time.
Andrew (01:55:27-01:55:28): Okay.
Andrew (01:55:28-01:55:33): So that's something that like if you add a drawer and you select the hardware.
Andrew (01:55:34-01:55:35): I can already make an assumption.
Andrew (01:55:35-01:55:38): The only thing I don't know is this is just Charles McClure.
Bryan (01:55:38-01:55:38): Yeah.
Andrew (01:55:39-01:55:40): Am I right?
Bryan (01:55:40-01:55:41): Okay, thank you.
Andrew (01:55:41-01:55:41): Cool.
Andrew (01:55:42-01:55:42): So and.
Bryan (01:55:42-01:55:46): And you have to have like, it has to be adjustable because what if it.
Andrew (01:55:46-01:55:48): It could take a drawer.
Andrew (01:55:48-01:55:49): I'm just.
Bryan (01:55:49-01:55:50): But they have a sink there.
Bryan (01:55:50-01:55:53): So it has to be a 12 inch people.
Bryan (01:55:54-01:55:54): Yeah.
Bryan (01:55:54-01:55:55): With depth.
Andrew (01:55:55-01:55:56): Yeah.
Andrew (01:55:56-01:55:59): So basically you just need an offset field as well.
Andrew (01:56:00-01:56:00): That's what it's called.
Bryan (01:56:01-01:56:01): Okay.
Andrew (01:56:01-01:56:02): So as in like.
Andrew (01:56:02-01:56:03): Hey, like this is what the.
Andrew (01:56:03-01:56:04): It computes.
Andrew (01:56:04-01:56:06): But we want to add an offset of.
Bryan (01:56:07-01:56:10): Because drawers you can go deep, they can be a U shaped drawer.
Bryan (01:56:10-01:56:11): Cutlery drawer.
Bryan (01:56:12-01:56:13): You should shoot around Pl.
Andrew (01:56:14-01:56:14): Yeah.
Bryan (01:56:14-01:56:15): Yeah.
Andrew (01:56:15-01:56:15): Oh really?
Andrew (01:56:16-01:56:17): That's pretty cool.
Andrew (01:56:17-01:56:21): Like also just I had a question about what else about.
Bryan (01:56:27-01:56:29): Don't we do that type.
Andrew (01:56:29-01:56:29): And you had.
Bryan (01:56:30-01:56:32): But you already did like when Doors and drawers.
Bryan (01:56:32-01:56:33): We did that.
Andrew (01:56:33-01:56:34): No, we did draw.
Andrew (01:56:34-01:56:35): We did doors.
Bryan (01:56:35-01:56:35): Okay.
Andrew (01:56:35-01:56:36): So yeah, doors.
Andrew (01:56:36-01:56:41): Do you want doors to also cover draw door faces?
Andrew (01:56:41-01:56:44): Are we just going to count them as the same thing or do you want to count them?
Andrew (01:56:46-01:56:48): No, I take that back.
Andrew (01:56:48-01:56:50): Each section should have its own face property.
Andrew (01:56:50-01:56:51): Okay.
Andrew (01:56:51-01:56:52): Yeah, yeah.
Bryan (01:56:53-01:56:59): And then when you define it could be flat slab, it could be paneled, it could be custom rail.
Bryan (01:56:59-01:57:00): It's rail in style.
Andrew (01:57:01-01:57:16): So I need you to understand what I'm saying that's going to happen now is you're going to have a parallel screen that when you add a cabinet to a cabinet run, it's going to ask you how many sections, how many openings are in it.
Andrew (01:57:16-01:57:22): Then it's going to ask you all those details and then you're going to do it as you're going.
Andrew (01:57:23-01:57:26): You're okay with me designing it that way?
Bryan (01:57:27-01:57:28): I don't want to do that.
Andrew (01:57:28-01:57:29): I know you don't.
Andrew (01:57:29-01:57:35): But like ideally for the best kind of use case scenario of all the data, that's the way that we're going to have to do it for now.
Andrew (01:57:35-01:57:38): Until we find a better way.
Bryan (01:57:38-01:57:40): Yeah, I'm certainly okay trying it.
Andrew (01:57:40-01:57:41): Okay, cool.
Andrew (01:57:42-01:57:46): It will take you a little more time to do, but it'll be well worth it.
Andrew (01:57:46-01:57:50): And then we can take out the things that like we never end up requiring.
Andrew (01:57:50-01:57:55): But for now it's gonna have too much that you can like take out.
Andrew (01:57:55-01:57:56): Okay, cool.
Andrew (01:57:57-01:57:58): Shelves.
Andrew (01:57:59-01:58:01): Oh, unless there's anything else on drawers at least.
Bryan (01:58:03-01:58:06): No, you're looking at the front of the cabinet.
Bryan (01:58:06-01:58:07): You have a door.
Bryan (01:58:07-01:58:07): We did all those options.
Bryan (01:58:07-01:58:09): You look at the front of the cabinet, we have a drawer.
Bryan (01:58:09-01:58:10): We did all those options.
Andrew (01:58:11-01:58:12): So what shelving options look like?
Bryan (01:58:12-01:58:14): It's like a cabinet internal.
Andrew (01:58:14-01:58:17): So how do you want to specify that?
Andrew (01:58:17-01:58:19): Whereas is it adjustable?
Andrew (01:58:19-01:58:19): Is it.
Andrew (01:58:20-01:58:20): Yeah.
Andrew (01:58:20-01:58:21): Adjustable or fixed?
Andrew (01:58:21-01:58:22): So that's a question.
Andrew (01:58:22-01:58:22): Yeah.
Andrew (01:58:22-01:58:23): What else is there?
Bryan (01:58:23-01:58:24): You could have a pullout.
Andrew (01:58:26-01:58:27): So that's still shelf.
Andrew (01:58:27-01:58:29): So I wouldn't do pull out and shelf separately.
Andrew (01:58:29-01:58:31): I would just go adjustable, fixed or pull out.
Andrew (01:58:31-01:58:32): It's just type of shelf.
Bryan (01:58:32-01:58:34): I was just on the New York State of Health.
Andrew (01:58:35-01:58:35): Yeah, right.
Andrew (01:58:38-01:58:39): Do you want to say where it.
Bryan (01:58:39-01:58:40): Is in position.
Andrew (01:58:42-01:58:47): X, Y and Z and whether the shelf is a U or any of those things?
Andrew (01:58:47-01:58:48): You need to tell me those things too.
Bryan (01:58:50-01:58:51): I don't think that's necessary.
Bryan (01:58:53-01:58:54): I think it would be.
Bryan (01:58:55-01:59:01): Where it's going to come into play is when I draw a section view and that goes to the CNC for programming.
Bryan (01:59:02-01:59:03): So it's not like they're.
Bryan (01:59:03-01:59:05): They're never laying out and drilling.
Andrew (01:59:06-01:59:07): Yeah.
Andrew (01:59:07-01:59:08): It's already CNC, so.
Bryan (01:59:08-01:59:10): Yeah, I don't think it's 36.
Andrew (01:59:10-01:59:11): Okay, cool.
Andrew (01:59:12-01:59:15): But you still need the type material.
Andrew (01:59:16-01:59:17): I still think we should have.
Andrew (01:59:17-01:59:21): No, the length, width, depth comes from the cabinet.
Andrew (01:59:22-01:59:22): Oh.
Andrew (01:59:22-01:59:26): Which tells me cabinet needs external and internal length away.
Bryan (01:59:26-01:59:28): 77 in ISO.
Bryan (01:59:28-01:59:29): So.
Bryan (01:59:29-01:59:31): So again you're gonna have like.
Bryan (01:59:31-01:59:35): If you're looking at a plan view of a cabinet, you're gonna have an overall but then you're gonna have openings.
Bryan (01:59:37-01:59:38): Correct?
Andrew (01:59:38-01:59:38): Right.
Andrew (01:59:39-01:59:41): So I just labeled it differently.
Andrew (01:59:41-01:59:43): It was internal and external, but we'll just call it open.
Andrew (01:59:43-01:59:48): So openings, what else?
Andrew (01:59:48-01:59:50): So that's base.
Andrew (01:59:50-01:59:50): Any other.
Bryan (01:59:55-01:59:55): All that's there.
Bryan (01:59:55-01:59:57): So I just was curious about what.
Andrew (01:59:57-01:59:59): Just give me the kick stuff again.
Andrew (01:59:59-02:00:01): Kick height, kick depth, what else?
Bryan (02:00:06-02:00:09): If we're considering like an appliance, could be.
Andrew (02:00:09-02:00:09): Yeah.
Bryan (02:00:09-02:00:11): A toe kick as well.
Bryan (02:00:11-02:00:12): Yeah, I guess.
Bryan (02:00:12-02:00:13): Whether it's loose or fixed.
Andrew (02:00:14-02:00:15): What's loose or fixed?
Bryan (02:00:15-02:00:16): Send a piece loose.
Andrew (02:00:17-02:00:17): Okay.
Bryan (02:00:17-02:00:19): Or send it attached to the cabinet.
Andrew (02:00:20-02:00:21): Do we.
Andrew (02:00:21-02:00:26): Do you need a field to say that this is the toe kick height, this is the toe kick depth is what I'm asking.
Andrew (02:00:28-02:00:30): And there'll be default values in there.
Bryan (02:00:30-02:00:34): That will be defined on the PDF of the face frame.
Bryan (02:00:34-02:00:39): Because a face frame will commonly come all the way to the ground and it'll have that defined there.
Bryan (02:00:40-02:00:40): Okay.
Andrew (02:00:40-02:00:41): Okay.
Andrew (02:00:42-02:00:43): Okay.
Andrew (02:00:43-02:00:43): Yeah.
Bryan (02:00:43-02:00:43): Okay.
Bryan (02:00:43-02:00:46): The one I showed you did not come to the ground, but it will.
Andrew (02:00:47-02:00:47): Okay.
Andrew (02:00:48-02:00:49): Okay.
Andrew (02:00:50-02:00:50): Any other.
Andrew (02:00:50-02:00:51): Okay.
Andrew (02:00:51-02:00:52): Appliance.
Andrew (02:00:52-02:00:53): Let's do the appliance type.
Bryan (02:00:54-02:01:01): What is that like a fridge with panels, a dishwasher with panels, Wine fridge, that kind of stuff.
Andrew (02:01:01-02:01:04): Yeah, but like what are we calling what.
Andrew (02:01:04-02:01:06): What fields do you need from it?
Bryan (02:01:08-02:01:09): Brand would be good.
Bryan (02:01:09-02:01:10): Oh, okay.
Andrew (02:01:10-02:01:10): So you need.
Andrew (02:01:10-02:01:12): You need actual appliance details.
Bryan (02:01:12-02:01:12): Yeah.
Bryan (02:01:13-02:01:14): Because how they mount can be different.
Andrew (02:01:15-02:01:15): Okay.
Andrew (02:01:15-02:01:16): So appliance details.
Andrew (02:01:17-02:01:25): And then you need a final area where you actually give the spec or the thing that you cut and tell me what that looks like.
Bryan (02:01:25-02:01:26): The final area where I'm giving the spec for.
Bryan (02:01:26-02:01:27): I'm cutting.
Andrew (02:01:27-02:01:27): Yes.
Andrew (02:01:27-02:01:32): But then like let's say we're not CNC here and someone has to hand make this.
Andrew (02:01:33-02:01:33): How do.
Andrew (02:01:33-02:01:34): How do I present that information?
Bryan (02:01:35-02:01:36): PDF upload.
Bryan (02:01:36-02:01:40): I'm going to pull the dimensions just like I'm doing a door.
Andrew (02:01:40-02:01:40): Okay.
Andrew (02:01:40-02:01:42): But there's nowhere that we can have.
Andrew (02:01:42-02:01:43): Oh no.
Andrew (02:01:43-02:01:45): I do need the XY because for materials.
Andrew (02:01:45-02:01:46): Total materials later.
Bryan (02:01:48-02:01:48): Yeah.
Bryan (02:01:48-02:01:49): Like a length and a width.
Andrew (02:01:49-02:01:50): Yeah.
Bryan (02:01:50-02:01:50): Yeah.
Andrew (02:01:52-02:01:53): Cool.
Andrew (02:01:53-02:01:53): That's it.
Andrew (02:01:53-02:01:54): It's just one.
Andrew (02:01:54-02:01:55): Usually just one board.
Andrew (02:01:55-02:01:56): Is it hinges?
Bryan (02:01:57-02:01:58): No hinges.
Andrew (02:01:58-02:01:59): Because it goes on the appliance.
Bryan (02:01:59-02:02:00): It goes on the appliance.
Bryan (02:02:00-02:02:01): Dishwasher is a dishwasher.
Bryan (02:02:02-02:02:02): A fridge is.
Bryan (02:02:02-02:02:03): Could be a side by side.
Bryan (02:02:03-02:02:04): It could be.
Bryan (02:02:04-02:02:06): Be a two door and three drawers.
Andrew (02:02:06-02:02:07): It could be.
Andrew (02:02:07-02:02:09): Okay, so what do I determine that.
Bryan (02:02:09-02:02:13): As when you have the brand name in there, you could put underneath it.
Bryan (02:02:13-02:02:13): Number of panels.
Bryan (02:02:14-02:02:15): Bosch dishwasher.
Bryan (02:02:15-02:02:16): Number of panels.
Bryan (02:02:16-02:02:18): One sub zero fridge on both.
Andrew (02:02:18-02:02:22): Because I also have to Label those panels P1, P2 blah.
Andrew (02:02:22-02:02:23): Cuz.
Andrew (02:02:23-02:02:23): Yeah.
Andrew (02:02:23-02:02:24): Okay, cool.
Andrew (02:02:24-02:02:25): All right.
Andrew (02:02:25-02:02:26): Are there any other base things?
Bryan (02:02:28-02:02:29): Nothing come to mind.
Andrew (02:02:30-02:02:31): What about countertop?
Andrew (02:02:31-02:02:32): How do we put that information?
Andrew (02:02:32-02:02:33): Do we need to put that information?
Andrew (02:02:33-02:02:34): How do we put it?
Andrew (02:02:34-02:02:35): What do you need?
Bryan (02:02:35-02:02:36): Yeah.
Bryan (02:02:36-02:02:37): Fabrication yes or no?
Andrew (02:02:37-02:02:38): Yes.
Bryan (02:02:38-02:02:39): If yes.
Bryan (02:02:39-02:02:41): Material, finish.
Andrew (02:02:41-02:02:43): Is that on the cabinet run level?
Bryan (02:02:44-02:02:45): It is on the cabinet run level.
Bryan (02:02:45-02:02:46): Correct.
Andrew (02:02:46-02:02:48): So it's asking doesn't have a countertop.
Andrew (02:02:49-02:02:50): Are we fabricating it or not?
Bryan (02:02:50-02:02:53): Thickness, length, width, thickness, length, width.
Andrew (02:02:53-02:02:56): Okay, profile and profile.
Andrew (02:02:56-02:02:58): What other profile types?
Bryan (02:02:58-02:03:00): I would just put it as a field.
Bryan (02:03:00-02:03:00): Jackson.
Andrew (02:03:00-02:03:01): Okay, cool.
Bryan (02:03:02-02:03:02): Cupboard.
Andrew (02:03:03-02:03:05): Every everything for base is covered.
Andrew (02:03:06-02:03:14): So in the cabinets we haven't said electrical or holes for electrical.
Bryan (02:03:16-02:03:17): We don't need to.
Andrew (02:03:17-02:03:18): We don't need those.
Bryan (02:03:18-02:03:18): No.
Andrew (02:03:18-02:03:19): God.
Andrew (02:03:19-02:03:20): Because the install will do all that on their own.
Bryan (02:03:21-02:03:21): Ability to do it on their own.
Bryan (02:03:21-02:03:23): But if it's planned, they're all Above.
Andrew (02:03:24-02:03:24): Okay, cool.
Andrew (02:03:24-02:03:25): Yeah.
Andrew (02:03:25-02:03:25): Office.
Bryan (02:03:27-02:03:27): Same thing.
Bryan (02:03:27-02:03:28): You don't need to plant.
Andrew (02:03:28-02:03:28): Yeah.
Andrew (02:03:28-02:03:32): Office is easy except for exhausts and things you need to talk a bit about.
Bryan (02:03:32-02:03:33): You have.
Bryan (02:03:33-02:03:33): Yeah.
Bryan (02:03:33-02:03:35): You'll have hood cabinets.
Andrew (02:03:35-02:03:35): Yep.
Bryan (02:03:35-02:03:38): Upper cabinets, standard open shelving.
Andrew (02:03:38-02:03:41): What feels a different end of the year.
Bryan (02:03:41-02:03:44): What fields are different underneath the cabinet.
Bryan (02:03:44-02:03:46): You don't have a toe kick, but you could have under cabinet lighting panel.
Andrew (02:03:47-02:03:48): Okay.
Bryan (02:03:48-02:03:48): So underside.
Bryan (02:03:48-02:03:51): You could have a category there for what is happening.
Bryan (02:03:51-02:03:51): Yeah.
Bryan (02:03:51-02:03:52): Because crown.
Bryan (02:03:53-02:03:55): You don't have a crown on the lower cabinet.
Andrew (02:03:55-02:03:55): Okay.
Bryan (02:03:55-02:03:56): So is there crown?
Bryan (02:03:56-02:03:58): If there is what type?
Andrew (02:03:58-02:03:59): Okay.
Andrew (02:03:59-02:04:01): And is that defined on the cabinet run level?
Andrew (02:04:02-02:04:04): Probably cabinet run level because it's going to be consistent.
Andrew (02:04:04-02:04:04): Right.
Andrew (02:04:06-02:04:07): What else is there about office?
Andrew (02:04:07-02:04:08): Okay.
Andrew (02:04:09-02:04:09): Mount.
Bryan (02:04:10-02:04:11): Mount.
Andrew (02:04:11-02:04:12): Like how's it mount out?
Bryan (02:04:12-02:04:13): I don't care.
Andrew (02:04:13-02:04:13): Okay.
Andrew (02:04:13-02:04:14): That's not our problem.
Andrew (02:04:14-02:04:15): Okay.
Bryan (02:04:15-02:04:17): Even if we install it, we got three quarter back.
Bryan (02:04:17-02:04:18): You screwed to the wall.
Andrew (02:04:18-02:04:18): Okay.
Bryan (02:04:18-02:04:19): Doesn't matter.
Bryan (02:04:22-02:04:24): You have doors same.
Bryan (02:04:24-02:04:25): You have adjustable shut.
Bryan (02:04:25-02:04:26): Pretty much.
Bryan (02:04:26-02:04:27): You don't really ever have pull outs.
Bryan (02:04:28-02:04:39): You have hood, which is like a unique one for opers where you would need to specify the mechanicals.
Bryan (02:04:39-02:04:40): What is actually going in there.
Andrew (02:04:40-02:04:43): So hood is just really appliance.
Andrew (02:04:44-02:04:46): It's the same as how we would handle an appliance.
Andrew (02:04:46-02:04:46): Right.
Andrew (02:04:46-02:04:46): Okay.
Andrew (02:04:46-02:04:47): Yeah.
Bryan (02:04:51-02:04:53): Blind corners you also have for uppers.
Andrew (02:04:54-02:04:55): Yeah.
Andrew (02:04:56-02:04:56): Okay.
Andrew (02:04:57-02:05:00): We didn't talk about like corner types and stuff.
Andrew (02:05:00-02:05:01): Like different types of.
Bryan (02:05:02-02:05:03): Yeah.
Andrew (02:05:03-02:05:05): How do we do that and how would you want to do that?
Bryan (02:05:05-02:05:07): Inside corner, you mean?
Andrew (02:05:07-02:05:07): Yeah.
Andrew (02:05:07-02:05:08): Like let's say it's like.
Andrew (02:05:08-02:05:09): Yeah, the inside corner.
Andrew (02:05:09-02:05:10): Or like how.
Andrew (02:05:10-02:05:12): How is that different and what information does.
Andrew (02:05:12-02:05:13): Does a builder need?
Andrew (02:05:14-02:05:15): Do you need to.
Andrew (02:05:15-02:05:19): Are there any variations on information and defining a cabin?
Bryan (02:05:19-02:05:21): What really changes we did at the door level?
Bryan (02:05:21-02:05:22): If it's blind hardware.
Andrew (02:05:23-02:05:23): Okay.
Andrew (02:05:23-02:05:25): So that we've already said because the.
Bryan (02:05:25-02:05:27): Opening would already be defined.
Bryan (02:05:27-02:05:27): It's done.
Andrew (02:05:27-02:05:28): Okay.
Andrew (02:05:28-02:05:31): Now full tell me what we're hockey.
Bryan (02:05:31-02:05:32): Pretty much the same.
Bryan (02:05:32-02:05:34): It's a little bit of a combo.
Bryan (02:05:34-02:05:35): Is there brown?
Bryan (02:05:35-02:05:37): What type of pull outs you got in it?
Andrew (02:05:37-02:05:37): Yeah.
Andrew (02:05:37-02:05:38): Okay.
Andrew (02:05:38-02:05:39): He brought the whole palette.
Andrew (02:05:40-02:05:43): I think we did it wrong.
Bryan (02:05:44-02:05:45): Oh, it looks super backwards.
Andrew (02:05:45-02:05:46): Yeah, that's what we've done.
Bryan (02:05:47-02:05:47): It's so pretty.
Andrew (02:05:48-02:05:48): All right.
Andrew (02:05:49-02:05:51): The reference holes are on this side.
Bryan (02:05:51-02:05:51): Yeah.
Andrew (02:05:51-02:05:53): So they just treated it like they'll.
Bryan (02:05:53-02:05:54): Have been on last year.
Bryan (02:05:54-02:05:55): We got to scrap a 3, 8.
Bryan (02:05:55-02:05:56): Can you find one?
Andrew (02:06:06-02:06:07): So close.
Bryan (02:06:07-02:06:10): Could almost reuse this, but it would be like.
Andrew (02:06:11-02:06:11): Yeah.
Andrew (02:06:12-02:06:13): And the holes will pop through.
Bryan (02:06:20-02:06:23): Send me a text if you find a scrap of 38 of what size?
Andrew (02:06:26-02:06:27): If you find a scrap of 3.
Andrew (02:06:27-02:06:27): 8.
Andrew (02:06:27-02:06:28): What size?
Andrew (02:06:28-02:06:32): Oh, anything we missed?
Andrew (02:06:32-02:06:33): The floor ceiling.
Bryan (02:06:33-02:06:34): It's a combination of the two.
Bryan (02:06:34-02:06:41): You have toe kick, you have end panels, you have crown, you have appliances in them, you have odd openings.
Andrew (02:06:43-02:06:44): I think that covers everything.
Andrew (02:06:44-02:06:45): Right.
Andrew (02:06:46-02:06:48): And that's a good base to start anyway.
Andrew (02:06:48-02:06:49): You can modify it as we move.
Andrew (02:06:49-02:06:50): Yeah.
Andrew (02:06:50-02:06:55): So now that you've filled all of that in, we have.
Andrew (02:06:55-02:06:56): What do we achieve out of that?
Andrew (02:06:57-02:06:57): A lot.
Bryan (02:06:58-02:07:04): Especially if we get like PDF uploads to the point where we get a group of tasks that can go to like a Levi or Shane.
Bryan (02:07:04-02:07:06): A task breakdown could be.
Bryan (02:07:07-02:07:10): So in there, we're gonna have cabinets labeled, we're gonna have a job labeled.
Andrew (02:07:10-02:07:12): We're gonna have correct all the things.
Bryan (02:07:12-02:07:12): That need to get happen.
Andrew (02:07:12-02:07:24): So just so you know, so I'm not having you double work is when you draw annotation in, it's going to grab that section and group it.
Bryan (02:07:24-02:07:25): To the room, group it to the.
Andrew (02:07:25-02:07:27): Cabinet run, group it to the thing.
Andrew (02:07:27-02:07:29): So when you're drawing a cabinet in, it'll draw the.
Andrew (02:07:29-02:07:32): It's grabbing the plan view of that cabinet.
Andrew (02:07:32-02:07:36): When you draw the elevation, it's grabbing that and attaching it to the cabinet.
Andrew (02:07:36-02:07:36): So you get.
Andrew (02:07:37-02:07:37): That's why I'm having.
Andrew (02:07:37-02:07:42): That's why I built this so that when you're going through the door at one time and then we extract all the information out.
Bryan (02:07:47-02:07:47): There.
Andrew (02:07:50-02:07:51): What else is missing from the sheet.
Andrew (02:07:52-02:07:55): How do I get a bill of materials from that?
Bryan (02:07:56-02:07:59): So you can get your hardware from that.
Andrew (02:07:59-02:08:00): Okay.
Bryan (02:08:01-02:08:05): We won't get the sheets until the programmer puts it through.
Bryan (02:08:07-02:08:08): VCarve.
Andrew (02:08:09-02:08:10): Can you get your linear feed from that?
Andrew (02:08:11-02:08:12): How do we measure linear feed?
Bryan (02:08:12-02:08:14): How do I measure linear feed?
Andrew (02:08:14-02:08:14): Yeah.
Andrew (02:08:14-02:08:15): In general, how do you measure a.
Bryan (02:08:15-02:08:19): Linear flow 12 inches lower or upper?
Andrew (02:08:22-02:08:23): What is the math of that, guys?
Andrew (02:08:23-02:08:29): Like, the linear field is like this right here is seven, six.
Andrew (02:08:29-02:08:30): Six linear feet?
Andrew (02:08:30-02:08:31): Yeah.
Bryan (02:08:31-02:08:32): Uppers, it's 12.
Andrew (02:08:32-02:08:32): Yeah.
Andrew (02:08:32-02:08:33): So it's like lower.
Andrew (02:08:33-02:08:38): Instead of doing like square footage, it's just like this is six linear feet.
Andrew (02:08:38-02:08:39): Okay.
Andrew (02:08:39-02:08:41): But then if it goes above, then there's 12 linear feet.
Andrew (02:08:43-02:08:45): I don't get that pot if it's.
Bryan (02:08:45-02:08:47): Upper and low, if it's a full height.
Andrew (02:08:47-02:08:49): Oh, okay.
Andrew (02:08:49-02:08:49): Yeah, yeah.
Andrew (02:08:50-02:08:50): Okay.
Andrew (02:08:50-02:08:51): What if it's.
Andrew (02:08:51-02:08:53): What if it's one that goes from here all the way up?
Andrew (02:08:54-02:08:56): That's one technically.
Andrew (02:08:56-02:08:57): Or I guess that's how the.
Andrew (02:08:57-02:09:02): So you'd get the most value out of like just building a bunch of tall cabinets?
Andrew (02:09:04-02:09:06): No, no, it's not exactly.
Bryan (02:09:06-02:09:09): No, because it's the WI fi password change.
Andrew (02:09:10-02:09:10): Nope.
Andrew (02:09:11-02:09:11): Is WI fi down?
Andrew (02:09:12-02:09:14): Well, it says check password and try again.
Andrew (02:09:15-02:09:16): Spectrum setup 65.
Andrew (02:09:16-02:09:17): No, I'm on.
Andrew (02:09:17-02:09:18): Is this you?
Andrew (02:09:18-02:09:19): I guess I got.
Andrew (02:09:19-02:09:20): Got kicked out during the time away.
Bryan (02:09:24-02:09:24): Selection.
Bryan (02:09:25-02:09:25): Green fish.
Andrew (02:09:26-02:09:29): Wait, so clarify the count.
Andrew (02:09:29-02:09:32): Let's say the couch is a base cabinet.
Andrew (02:09:32-02:09:32): Like the floor cabinet.
Andrew (02:09:33-02:09:34): That is how many.
Andrew (02:09:34-02:09:35): How many liter is that?
Bryan (02:09:35-02:09:35): Six.
Andrew (02:09:36-02:09:38): So if someone's building an upper, then that's another 6Y.
Andrew (02:09:38-02:09:41): So that's 12 you would build for in total.
Andrew (02:09:41-02:09:43): What happens if they build a cabinet that's this?
Andrew (02:09:45-02:09:46): That's still six.
Andrew (02:09:47-02:09:48): It's floor ceiling.
Bryan (02:09:48-02:09:50): Yeah, it's 12 layer feet.
Andrew (02:09:50-02:09:50): You double it.
Andrew (02:09:51-02:09:51): Oh, okay.
Andrew (02:09:51-02:09:53): So anything floor to ceiling is doubled.
Andrew (02:09:53-02:09:56): Yeah, this math is not math.
Andrew (02:09:57-02:09:59): Oh, it's just an easy way to fit the bid.
Andrew (02:10:00-02:10:01): It's such a dumb way to bid.
Andrew (02:10:05-02:10:05): What?
Andrew (02:10:05-02:10:07): It's kind of a standard though.
Andrew (02:10:07-02:10:08): No, that's not what I mean.
Andrew (02:10:08-02:10:13): Because in terms of actually working out how much material that number helps me with, Jack all.
Andrew (02:10:14-02:10:15): Do you know what I'm saying?
Andrew (02:10:15-02:10:17): Like it's not a real number.
Andrew (02:10:18-02:10:19): You're right.
Andrew (02:10:19-02:10:20): But it gets the ballpark.
Andrew (02:10:20-02:10:27): Your entire Y axis is completely variable every time and it could be hugely variable.
Andrew (02:10:27-02:10:28): Okay, I've got a question.
Andrew (02:10:28-02:10:29): What if it's this tall?
Andrew (02:10:31-02:10:33): What are we charging for that?
Andrew (02:10:33-02:10:34): Where is the gray zone here?
Andrew (02:10:34-02:10:37): Well, that's the difference is that is special.
Andrew (02:10:37-02:10:39): And it's almost never happens.
Andrew (02:10:39-02:10:43): I mean like take for example that the gardener job.
Andrew (02:10:43-02:10:43): Yeah.
Bryan (02:10:44-02:10:46): Everything is exactly the same size except.
Andrew (02:10:46-02:10:50): For one cabinet, the dishwasher.
Andrew (02:10:50-02:10:51): I mean the laundry.
Andrew (02:10:52-02:10:52): And.
Andrew (02:10:53-02:10:53): Yeah.
Andrew (02:10:53-02:10:56): So it's like, it's not that often that happens.
Andrew (02:10:57-02:10:58): Okay.
Andrew (02:11:00-02:11:04): Because I'm trying to work out a way to like automatically calculate things.
Andrew (02:11:04-02:11:05): And that's crazy.
Andrew (02:11:06-02:11:11): The variation on like this is the same price as this.
Andrew (02:11:11-02:11:15): And then there's a threshold where we start to go, it's more.
Andrew (02:11:15-02:11:16): What is that threshold?
Bryan (02:11:16-02:11:27): Well, the way it works out monetarily is like it's a little bit overpriced for uppers and lowers separately.
Bryan (02:11:27-02:11:32): And it's definitely underpriced for full height because it's like triple the cost of materials.
Andrew (02:11:32-02:11:33): That's what I'm saying.
Andrew (02:11:33-02:11:33): Yeah.
Bryan (02:11:34-02:11:35): Just works out in the wash.
Andrew (02:11:36-02:11:36): Okay.
Andrew (02:11:37-02:11:50): It bugs me because I can't work out true materials because it's so variable in that it's like someone's kitchen could be a different height to another person's kitchen and it's like 10%.
Andrew (02:11:50-02:11:52): But we're really Just calling it a wash, you know?
Andrew (02:11:52-02:11:52): Know.
Andrew (02:11:57-02:11:58): I mean, I don't know.
Andrew (02:11:58-02:12:01): The way I think about it, though, is we're not a.
Andrew (02:12:03-02:12:07): Like a box building shop, like, where it's easy to calculate.
Andrew (02:12:07-02:12:08): All that is custom.
Andrew (02:12:08-02:12:09): No, again, it's hard to.
Andrew (02:12:09-02:12:10): It's like ordering material.
Andrew (02:12:10-02:12:12): But we do order overages, so y.
Andrew (02:12:13-02:12:19): It's like, not that big a deal if we've always ordered overage.
Andrew (02:12:20-02:12:24): How is that we don't have a ton of loose spare material.
Bryan (02:12:24-02:12:24): We do.
Bryan (02:12:24-02:12:26): We're overflowing 3/4 magics right now.
Bryan (02:12:26-02:12:28): It's because I.
Bryan (02:12:28-02:12:33): We have not been unsuccessful for a year.
Bryan (02:12:33-02:12:34): Is it?
Andrew (02:12:34-02:12:34): Yeah.
Bryan (02:12:34-02:12:36): And every now and then, I know I don't have to order for a job.
Andrew (02:12:37-02:12:37): Oh.
Bryan (02:12:37-02:12:40): I've done all of this just naturally.
Bryan (02:12:41-02:12:43): Not, like, with structure.
Andrew (02:12:43-02:12:45): What is a bare minimum on.
Andrew (02:12:45-02:12:51): Of inventory stock that you want to hold for emergencies versus allocatable?
Andrew (02:12:57-02:13:03): I mean, like, if something comes in and, like, the inventory person goes, yeah, we've got 20 sheets.
Andrew (02:13:03-02:13:09): I shouldn't allow him to take 20 sheets because what if something goes wrong in this other job?
Bryan (02:13:11-02:13:13): Oh, I don't think we really have that.
Bryan (02:13:13-02:13:14): Everything's accessible right now.
Bryan (02:13:17-02:13:17): You know what I mean?
Bryan (02:13:17-02:13:21): Like, it's really easy to get things from the supplier right now.
Andrew (02:13:38-02:13:39): That was so weird.
Bryan (02:13:43-02:13:44): Did it fix it?
Andrew (02:13:44-02:13:46): Yeah, it literally just.
Andrew (02:13:46-02:13:48): The WI fi portion of my computer was just.
Bryan (02:13:48-02:13:49): It was just down.
Andrew (02:13:50-02:13:50): Huh.
Andrew (02:13:51-02:13:53): Like, I couldn't even access the settings.
Bryan (02:13:54-02:13:55): Yeah, that's very weird.
Andrew (02:13:55-02:13:57): I've never had that happen in the world.
Andrew (02:13:58-02:14:00): I just restarted it, and it's fine now.
Andrew (02:14:02-02:14:04): Got to Come on.
Andrew (02:14:04-02:14:06): I just got to grab a quick little bit of information.
Andrew (02:14:08-02:14:08): 19.
Bryan (02:14:08-02:14:10): Gardner Panel 6.
Andrew (02:14:12-02:14:17): Hey, Brian, is your detailer doing what I just told you to do after you've drawn the rhino?
Andrew (02:14:18-02:14:19): Because that can happen, too.
Andrew (02:14:20-02:14:21): Say it again.
Andrew (02:14:21-02:14:26): Can your detailer not go back and fill in all the stuff I just asked for and you don't have to fill in the straw?
Bryan (02:14:29-02:14:37): Yeah, that's why I'm saying that's all muddy right there in how we get to section views, to CNC files, to job cards.
Andrew (02:14:41-02:14:45): Because you can do it while you're drawing, or you can have someone come back and fill it in.
Andrew (02:14:47-02:14:53): Job Cards is easy for me to work out because it's assigning a cabinet to a person.
Andrew (02:14:54-02:15:02): And if you give Levi a cabinet, like, here's the cabinet, here's all the sections used, and here's all the reviews for it.
Andrew (02:15:03-02:15:07): And then here's the spec sheet of materials, and here's where all your materials are.
Andrew (02:15:08-02:15:09): What Else does Levi need?
Bryan (02:15:09-02:15:14): Well, Levi doesn't need to know where materials are because he needs to know where cut pieces are from the cnc.
Andrew (02:15:14-02:15:14): Right.
Andrew (02:15:14-02:15:16): So material like to make.
Andrew (02:15:16-02:15:18): It doesn't matter if it's cut or how to cut.
Andrew (02:15:18-02:15:20): He just needs to know where my stuff is.
Andrew (02:15:22-02:15:23): What else does he need?
Bryan (02:15:24-02:15:24): That's it.
Andrew (02:15:26-02:15:29): Okay, so what did Levi do when he's done?
Bryan (02:15:30-02:15:33): Drops it off to get to finishing.
Andrew (02:15:34-02:15:35): But how do we know he did that?
Bryan (02:15:38-02:15:39): You're gonna build something.
Bryan (02:15:39-02:15:39): Tells me.
Andrew (02:15:41-02:15:44): What is the bare minimum that Levi wants to.
Andrew (02:15:44-02:15:48): To determine that so he doesn't have to do anything except say it's been dropped off.
Andrew (02:15:48-02:15:50): You guys names getting thrown around a lot?
Andrew (02:15:50-02:15:51): You don't need to answer that.
Andrew (02:15:52-02:15:52): What do you.
Andrew (02:15:52-02:15:54): What do you want to say at the end when you're done?
Andrew (02:15:54-02:15:55): I'm done with a cabinet.
Andrew (02:15:55-02:15:59): What does I'm done look like or like ready for finishing.
Andrew (02:15:59-02:16:00): What do you want to do?
Andrew (02:16:00-02:16:02): That is what I'm done for me is give it.
Andrew (02:16:02-02:16:03): How are you doing it right now?
Bryan (02:16:05-02:16:06): Drop it off to finishing.
Andrew (02:16:06-02:16:09): And then how does Brian know it dropped off and finishing?
Andrew (02:16:10-02:16:11): He doesn't.
Andrew (02:16:12-02:16:17): Oh, and then how do you start a new job?
Andrew (02:16:18-02:16:19): He's got.
Andrew (02:16:20-02:16:24): Well, I mean, for the most part, I usually know what jobs we're working on.
Andrew (02:16:24-02:16:26): And then now we start doing these.
Andrew (02:16:27-02:16:27): How are these?
Andrew (02:16:28-02:16:29): Is it better?
Andrew (02:16:29-02:16:30): It's all right.
Andrew (02:16:30-02:16:30): Things.
Andrew (02:16:31-02:16:32): I think it would better if everyone.
Andrew (02:16:33-02:16:36): Papers get moved around a lot and things get lost.
Andrew (02:16:36-02:16:38): But apart.
Andrew (02:16:38-02:16:39): Yeah, apart from the physical losing of it.
Andrew (02:16:39-02:16:41): But is the process better?
Andrew (02:16:42-02:16:44): yeah.
Andrew (02:16:44-02:16:45): Yes, I think.
Andrew (02:16:46-02:16:47): I mean it was.
Andrew (02:16:47-02:16:48): It's just a.
Andrew (02:16:48-02:16:52): It's an extra sheet on top of what were kind of to me, what were already.
Andrew (02:16:52-02:16:53): Did you find it?
Andrew (02:16:53-02:16:54): Sure.
Andrew (02:16:54-02:16:55): Come with this book?
Andrew (02:16:56-02:16:59): I'm told in this book, I'm told, yeah.
Andrew (02:16:59-02:17:09): Not actually job comes in, there's a job spec that's made and that job spec is then taken up here.
Andrew (02:17:09-02:17:11): So all the field dimensions are in there.
Andrew (02:17:11-02:17:12): That goes to the designer.
Andrew (02:17:12-02:17:15): The designer fills in all the specs for it.
Andrew (02:17:15-02:17:18): There's like lots of detail things like face training stuff.
Andrew (02:17:18-02:17:20): Any kind of information per.
Andrew (02:17:20-02:17:24): And the way we've broken it down is this is the room that things going in.
Andrew (02:17:24-02:17:26): This is the cabinet run, whether it's a base or an upper.
Andrew (02:17:27-02:17:29): And then what are the cabinets inside that cabinet?
Andrew (02:17:29-02:17:32): So cabinet one, cabinet two, cabinet three.
Andrew (02:17:32-02:17:35): Inside each cabinet are openings opening one, two and three.
Andrew (02:17:35-02:17:42): The drawer opening is a general box opening or the shelf opening and then rhinophiles at the back.
Andrew (02:17:43-02:17:49): And then what Comes out for you is things you cut parts and a perspective.
Andrew (02:17:50-02:17:52): Is that what that is now?
Andrew (02:17:52-02:17:55): Well, this, yeah, the job card comes out.
Andrew (02:17:56-02:17:57): It depends on you.
Andrew (02:17:57-02:18:09): So what Brian and I were talking about is like, do you want to just get given a cabinet and handle the cabinet, or do you want to get in the cabinet and then like there are all these things that need to be job down.
Andrew (02:18:09-02:18:12): How do you want to track jobbing it out?
Andrew (02:18:13-02:18:16): And how do we do that properly without you just going, hey, can you go do this thing for me?
Andrew (02:18:16-02:18:17): And we'd have to help.
Andrew (02:18:19-02:18:19): How is that.
Andrew (02:18:19-02:18:20): How is that defined?
Andrew (02:18:20-02:18:26): You want defined previously where it's like, hey, like section one, these are all the tasks that need to be done for that.
Andrew (02:18:26-02:18:28): Section two, these are all tasks to be done for that.
Bryan (02:18:31-02:18:35): Because that makes the shipping ledger now.
Andrew (02:18:35-02:18:36): Well, the shipping ledger's already built.
Andrew (02:18:36-02:18:39): When we are defining cabinets, that's already done.
Andrew (02:18:39-02:18:41): That's instantly done automatically.
Andrew (02:18:41-02:18:44): The bill of lading can be done purely from the work we just talked about.
Bryan (02:18:45-02:18:48): So then the same thing for him already, because if it's a build later.
Andrew (02:18:48-02:18:52): So right now I can assign tasks.
Andrew (02:18:52-02:18:56): So all the stuff we just talked about, I can assign tasks at every level.
Andrew (02:18:56-02:19:09): I can assign room level, cabinet level, cabinet run level, section level, tasks which you can then go, I'm making a task for so and so, and I'm assigning it to this section.
Andrew (02:19:09-02:19:15): And then what it does is it grabs everything related to that section and attaches it to that task automatically.
Andrew (02:19:15-02:19:16): So what if you just make a.
Bryan (02:19:17-02:19:20): Crap pile of them and you give him the ability to assign a route?
Andrew (02:19:20-02:19:23): Yeah, he will have the ability to make tasks, but he's gonna have to make tasks.
Andrew (02:19:23-02:19:25): Now when do you want.
Andrew (02:19:25-02:19:27): Do you want to sit and do that before you do the job?
Andrew (02:19:27-02:19:32): You mean like I need to do that on the computer or you're gonna do that running is what I'm saying.
Andrew (02:19:32-02:19:35): I think I would if it was me.
Andrew (02:19:35-02:19:36): I'd prefer to have that.
Andrew (02:19:36-02:19:44): Like, if I saw all the odds and ends of like, if we're going to buy a room, I'd like to just see it on a card.
Andrew (02:19:45-02:19:48): Because everyone works different speeds and different levels.
Andrew (02:19:48-02:19:49): And like I.
Andrew (02:19:50-02:19:53): And how things actually turn out throughout the day are different than planning.
Andrew (02:19:53-02:20:03): My preference from a productive workflow kind of way is I would prefer not to start a job until you have planned all the job out.
Bryan (02:20:03-02:20:04): Yeah, we don't get that luxury.
Andrew (02:20:07-02:20:10): So what's the compromise here and what I like?
Andrew (02:20:10-02:20:14): I'll tell you what, I mean, let's Say that you start a new base cabinet.
Andrew (02:20:14-02:20:16): There's three cabinets in that run, right.
Andrew (02:20:17-02:20:18): How are you normally doing?
Andrew (02:20:19-02:20:21): He comes in and says, hey, you've got a.
Andrew (02:20:21-02:20:23): Well, you tell me.
Andrew (02:20:24-02:20:25): Well, I guess it all depends on.
Andrew (02:20:25-02:20:29): Depends on whether on like.
Andrew (02:20:29-02:20:32): I mean for Pulpus, I came in and everything was ready.
Andrew (02:20:32-02:20:34): All I needed to do was start putting things together.
Andrew (02:20:34-02:20:35): Put face frame.
Bryan (02:20:36-02:20:37): We're starting on gardener.
Andrew (02:20:37-02:20:38): We don't have the stuff cut for that.
Andrew (02:20:38-02:20:40): So I started making face frames.
Andrew (02:20:40-02:20:48): I started doing oak tops and I know that I'm ahead there, but I just need to wait for Shane to get the files to cut the CNC and then combine the two.
Andrew (02:20:48-02:20:54): For productivity point of view, I would prefer that you stop and not be cutting things for half an hour.
Andrew (02:20:54-02:21:02): If you planned it out, if you spent that half an hour and looked at what it is that you plan to do and then execute the plan rather than do it right.
Andrew (02:21:02-02:21:08): That's my like I know from a productivity point of view that's the best way to do it.
Bryan (02:21:08-02:21:09): They do that.
Bryan (02:21:09-02:21:10): You always get the place.
Bryan (02:21:10-02:21:11): You sit down.
Bryan (02:21:11-02:21:12): I mean we go through them and.
Andrew (02:21:12-02:21:13): Know what we want to do.
Andrew (02:21:13-02:21:14): But not every.
Andrew (02:21:14-02:21:15): Because here's what I mean.
Andrew (02:21:15-02:21:16): Look.
Andrew (02:21:16-02:21:18): So let's say you're building something upper and it needs crown.
Andrew (02:21:19-02:21:19): Okay.
Andrew (02:21:19-02:21:22): You're going to part out the crown making.
Andrew (02:21:22-02:21:26): For example, I need you to actually make the task for crown making.
Andrew (02:21:27-02:21:31): So and then assign it before you like and not do it on the fly.
Andrew (02:21:31-02:21:32): I think I have this before Levi.
Bryan (02:21:34-02:21:39): That happens that's the shipping ledger.
Andrew (02:21:39-02:21:43): As long as to make the cross the task.
Bryan (02:21:44-02:21:47): They're connected because you do it one time and it does.
Andrew (02:21:47-02:21:49): It's the information.
Andrew (02:21:49-02:21:50): No, no, the task is made.
Andrew (02:21:50-02:21:53): It's like, no, I'll change crown out.
Andrew (02:21:53-02:21:57): I mean, let's say that you need help with something on your cabinet.
Andrew (02:21:57-02:21:57): Right.
Andrew (02:21:57-02:22:03): It's not like there's something that you can pass someone else who can do easily or repetitively over and over.
Andrew (02:22:03-02:22:05): How are you currently asking for help?
Bryan (02:22:09-02:22:10): Gosh.
Andrew (02:22:10-02:22:16): I mean it's just depending on how much I have for the work for the day and like what I plan on taking on.
Andrew (02:22:16-02:22:19): I'll farm out things that I'm working on.
Andrew (02:22:19-02:22:28): But so that what I'm asking is that farming out is done in a task and not just hey, are you doing anything?
Andrew (02:22:28-02:22:29): Can you go cut that for me?
Andrew (02:22:29-02:22:32): Because I don't know where materials.
Andrew (02:22:32-02:22:33): I don't know what's happening.
Andrew (02:22:33-02:22:35): There's no way of tracking that.
Andrew (02:22:36-02:22:39): So what I'm Saying is like that you had sat down and gone.
Andrew (02:22:39-02:22:40): I've got this much to do.
Andrew (02:22:40-02:22:43): I'm gonna need help doing these things to get this cabinet done.
Andrew (02:22:43-02:22:46): I'm making a task and I'm assigning it to this section.
Andrew (02:22:46-02:22:47): I'm assigning it to this person.
Andrew (02:22:47-02:22:51): But you're doing it sitting and not doing it yelling at someone.
Andrew (02:22:52-02:22:52): I think that's the thing.
Bryan (02:22:52-02:22:56): I like that because I think about McKenna and I don't want it to be sitting down.
Bryan (02:22:56-02:23:00): If it's something that's like on a phone, but she's just gonna type whatever we're telling her.
Andrew (02:23:01-02:23:01): So.
Andrew (02:23:01-02:23:02): So that.
Andrew (02:23:02-02:23:02): Like that.
Andrew (02:23:02-02:23:03): That.
Andrew (02:23:03-02:23:08): Yeah, even so like you with a McKenna.
Andrew (02:23:08-02:23:11): I mean, at least let's just use McKenna for example, because Shane's running the.
Bryan (02:23:11-02:23:13): CNC, so McKenna was really the only helper.
Andrew (02:23:16-02:23:19): I could give her a big list of things to do and.
Andrew (02:23:19-02:23:22): But that didn't always mean I could just completely let go.
Bryan (02:23:22-02:23:24): I would still check in and make sure.
Bryan (02:23:25-02:23:26): Yeah, this is what he needs.
Bryan (02:23:26-02:23:27): In my opinion.
Bryan (02:23:28-02:23:37): He needs like a Google sheet or something that says the job that's associated with a drop down for the cabinet that it's associated with and a descriptive just to enter.
Andrew (02:23:39-02:23:41): I might have to run more because.
Bryan (02:23:41-02:23:43): This is having a bit of a mental breakdown.
Bryan (02:23:43-02:23:44): Yeah, no worries.
Bryan (02:23:45-02:23:45): Sorry, man.
Andrew (02:23:49-02:23:50): We got it.
Andrew (02:23:53-02:23:53): I'll tell you what I mean.
Andrew (02:23:54-02:24:13): If I am about to take on a cabinet and I'm Levi, this is how I would ideally want it and you can tell me if this is doable or not, is that before he takes the job on, he already has broken down in his mind what he can part out and what complicated things he needs to work on.
Andrew (02:24:13-02:24:15): Because you can assign tasks at everything.
Andrew (02:24:16-02:24:24): You can assign tasks to a door, you can assign tasks to an opening, you can assign tasks to a whole cabinet and you can assign it to any person.
Andrew (02:24:25-02:24:33): So like when he's doing the planning phase, like he's just been given the job, he's going, okay, I can do all that.
Andrew (02:24:34-02:24:37): I probably should get so and so started on sanding this stuff down.
Andrew (02:24:39-02:24:41): Sanding assigned to cabinet.
Andrew (02:24:42-02:24:47): Then that person, let's say that he's starting his job on a Monday and they come in on a Wednesday.
Andrew (02:24:47-02:24:50): He's like, I don't have to worry about that for now.
Andrew (02:24:50-02:24:51): Someone else can do that down the road.
Andrew (02:24:51-02:24:56): He can make the task so that it's ready for that person when they come in Wednesday.
Andrew (02:24:56-02:24:58): That's what I'm talking about.
Andrew (02:24:58-02:25:06): But you need dedicated time and they do it on the floor because I've seen them out there with the paper plans, just leaning over their bench reading the plan before they start.
Andrew (02:25:06-02:25:07): That's a thing.
Andrew (02:25:07-02:25:12): But I just need that documented and not just in their minds.
Andrew (02:25:13-02:25:15): So you tell me how I can get that.
Bryan (02:25:15-02:25:16): Yeah, because that's going to be too much.
Bryan (02:25:16-02:25:17): It's going to be.
Bryan (02:25:18-02:25:21): The idea is good, the execution should be simpler.
Andrew (02:25:22-02:25:25): Yeah, don't worry about how long it's going to take.
Andrew (02:25:25-02:25:26): That's my job.
Andrew (02:25:26-02:25:28): But that's what the concept is, what I'm saying.
Bryan (02:25:28-02:25:30): The execution for them cannot be long.
Andrew (02:25:31-02:25:32): It needs to be simple.
Andrew (02:25:32-02:25:34): It needs to be a simple, simple thing.
Andrew (02:25:34-02:25:35): If it's complicated, they won't do it.
Andrew (02:25:37-02:25:42): Can they write it on a piece of paper and then get a person to fill it in?
Bryan (02:25:44-02:25:45): Why aren't people creating a job?
Bryan (02:25:46-02:25:52): What I think would better would be to look at what is our end product out the door, which is.
Andrew (02:25:52-02:25:54): Our bill of laden.
Bryan (02:25:55-02:25:57): Because it's not a kitchen for Andrew.
Bryan (02:25:57-02:26:00): It's on the individual cabinets, individual doors.
Andrew (02:26:00-02:26:02): Like all like that bill of lading is already made here.
Andrew (02:26:03-02:26:08): So by the time you're done here, the building, the tasks, you should just tie to that.
Andrew (02:26:08-02:26:10): If they have a task that's in.
Bryan (02:26:10-02:26:11): A drop down for job and an.
Andrew (02:26:11-02:26:17): Item, that's how I can like let me show you tasks right now because you need to see what it looks like so you get what I'm talking about.
Andrew (02:26:24-02:26:24): Yeah.
Andrew (02:26:25-02:26:27): So coming up, the task.
Andrew (02:26:29-02:26:30): You cold?
Bryan (02:26:30-02:26:31): I'm freezing.
Andrew (02:26:33-02:26:34): When I hit a new task.
Andrew (02:26:36-02:26:38): I have a whole tag system.
Bryan (02:26:39-02:26:40): Oh, I broke my tag system.
Andrew (02:26:40-02:26:41): I'll fix that later.
Andrew (02:26:43-02:26:53): And let's say I go, I can assign that task to a room and then assign it.
Andrew (02:26:54-02:26:57): This will be easier later, but I can assign it all the way down.
Andrew (02:26:58-02:27:01): I actually have the design changed to be column so you don't have to.
Bryan (02:27:01-02:27:02): Go through all the levels.
Andrew (02:27:02-02:27:09): But the idea is that this task can be made for any phase, for any section.
Andrew (02:27:09-02:27:15): And the task can also have tags attached to it like urgent, not urgent.
Andrew (02:27:16-02:27:19): All the types of things that you could possibly think of are there.
Andrew (02:27:20-02:27:21): And then the idea.
Andrew (02:27:21-02:27:23): It could also be attached to a milestone.
Andrew (02:27:23-02:27:28): So when this task has been completed, I can allow it to move to the next phase.
Andrew (02:27:28-02:27:32): It has assignees, it has deadlines, it has allocated hours.
Andrew (02:27:33-02:27:35): You don't have to fill anything in.
Andrew (02:27:35-02:27:39): You can just fill in the title if you wanted to, general tasks.
Andrew (02:27:39-02:27:41): But it's automatically associated to a project already.
Andrew (02:27:42-02:27:50): But I'm saying that if I'm working on something, I Will probably make a way to bulk make tasks with all the same data.
Andrew (02:27:50-02:27:52): So let's say that we're working on a cabinet.
Andrew (02:27:52-02:27:59): You go into the cabinet, you create a task, you get to add multi line of tasks and then assign all the people and it goes out.
Andrew (02:28:00-02:28:08): But the idea is that you can say for the cabinet, doors need sanding.
Andrew (02:28:08-02:28:11): So I'm going to select the cabinet and then I'm going to say, doors need sanding.
Andrew (02:28:11-02:28:12): I'm assigned it to whatever.
Andrew (02:28:15-02:28:16): That's what I'm saying to you.
Andrew (02:28:17-02:28:20): And then everyone will just have a task list just show up.
Andrew (02:28:24-02:28:25): I've already built it.
Andrew (02:28:25-02:28:27): I'm just like getting it.
Andrew (02:28:27-02:28:28): I just haven't handed it to you.
Bryan (02:28:32-02:28:33): I think it falls the same category.
Bryan (02:28:33-02:28:35): Let's work it out, let's test it out.
Bryan (02:28:35-02:28:36): Because I think it's a great idea.
Bryan (02:28:36-02:28:38): Because then everybody has their own work.
Andrew (02:28:39-02:28:41): But how do I get it so that you can do it?
Andrew (02:28:42-02:28:49): And like, so McKenna, the day before she comes in, if her tasks are already assigned, she knows what she's done.
Andrew (02:28:49-02:28:50): She can look.
Andrew (02:28:50-02:28:52): Oh, man, I've got eight tasks I get done today.
Andrew (02:28:52-02:28:54): They've already assigned it to me.
Andrew (02:28:54-02:28:55): Can't have a sick day to date.
Andrew (02:28:55-02:28:57): There's like 20 things going on.
Andrew (02:28:57-02:28:58): Oh, it's gonna be a quick day for me.
Andrew (02:28:58-02:29:00): I've only got four tasks it's gonna take me to.
Andrew (02:29:00-02:29:03): Then in each task, just update where you're at.
Andrew (02:29:05-02:29:06): Connects to your timesheets.
Andrew (02:29:07-02:29:10): Yeah, I've already built so much of it.
Andrew (02:29:11-02:29:16): That's why I'm saying I need to know that this will get used.
Andrew (02:29:16-02:29:17): And how do I.
Andrew (02:29:17-02:29:20): What do I need to change about it to make it get used?
Bryan (02:29:20-02:29:22): And we won't know that until we start using it.
Andrew (02:29:23-02:29:23): Okay.
Andrew (02:29:25-02:29:31): I know, for example, that task creation thing and task checking thing has to be for phone compatible.
Bryan (02:29:32-02:29:32): Has to.
Andrew (02:29:32-02:29:33): Yeah.
Andrew (02:29:33-02:29:38): And so I already designed it in a way that you're viewing it here with this in mind.
Andrew (02:29:38-02:29:38): And none of this.
Bryan (02:29:39-02:29:40): I think they should have a baseline.
Bryan (02:29:42-02:29:44): So if we have.
Andrew (02:29:46-02:29:56): The thing that I don't have that I really need is what are landmarks for passing things.
Andrew (02:29:57-02:29:58): Cabinet built.
Bryan (02:30:00-02:30:01): You know, we already did that.
Bryan (02:30:01-02:30:02): It's in the notion page.
Bryan (02:30:04-02:30:05): These are them right here.
Bryan (02:30:35-02:30:40): So you have fabrication, spray, booth QC for delivery.
Bryan (02:30:40-02:30:42): Loaded, delivered meets attention.
Andrew (02:30:43-02:30:48): So with every project that is activated and with every stage that's activated.
Andrew (02:30:48-02:30:49): Let me just show you.
Andrew (02:30:49-02:30:55): So our projects have milestones.
Andrew (02:30:55-02:30:58): I need to add project milestones.
Andrew (02:30:59-02:30:59): Right.
Andrew (02:31:00-02:31:06): So is there a consolidated list of milestones for me in the.
Andrew (02:31:06-02:31:07): In that in Written in that way.
Andrew (02:31:07-02:31:08): Just a clear.
Bryan (02:31:11-02:31:12): You know what I would add.
Andrew (02:31:12-02:31:13): No, no, no.
Andrew (02:31:16-02:31:17): What says that we're done.
Bryan (02:31:20-02:31:24): When you have 30% deposit.
Andrew (02:31:24-02:31:25): Okay, so that's a milestone.
Andrew (02:31:26-02:31:27): So.
Andrew (02:31:28-02:31:30): So one of the tasks is receive payment.
Andrew (02:31:32-02:31:36): If received payment is done, I can move the project to design.
Andrew (02:31:37-02:31:38): It will move its phase.
Andrew (02:31:38-02:31:42): So that way in your global system you can see where things are.
Andrew (02:31:42-02:31:45): What is the thing that says that this is done?
Bryan (02:31:47-02:31:48): It's written right up there.
Bryan (02:31:48-02:31:49): You have.
Andrew (02:31:51-02:31:56): The bible part is filled out and the design and cnc.
Andrew (02:31:57-02:31:57): Yes.
Andrew (02:31:57-02:31:58): And the bomb.
Bryan (02:31:59-02:32:00): The materials made.
Bryan (02:32:01-02:32:02): Your NC files made.
Bryan (02:32:02-02:32:04): Your reference files are done.
Bryan (02:32:04-02:32:06): Your job cards are done.
Andrew (02:32:06-02:32:07): Okay, so.
Andrew (02:32:07-02:32:10): Oh, job cards are done.
Andrew (02:32:10-02:32:12): Now there's the next question.
Andrew (02:32:13-02:32:14): How much detail is the job card?
Andrew (02:32:15-02:32:20): Because the job card you have task level job cards and you have cabinet level job cards.
Andrew (02:32:21-02:32:23): Which one talking about here.
Bryan (02:32:25-02:32:27): I think we should not have task level job cards.
Bryan (02:32:27-02:32:32): Then we should just have cabinet level job cards and then you can farm out your tasks that you're saying, right?
Andrew (02:32:32-02:32:42): So if you're making cabinet level job cards, then in that cabinet level job card you have, you need to make tasks in there.
Andrew (02:32:43-02:32:44): And how do you normally make that?
Andrew (02:32:44-02:32:47): And what is a cabinet level task?
Bryan (02:32:48-02:32:57): Build a cabinet, build a face frame, sand the doors, make the crown, make a countertop, attach the trim, send the trim loose.
Andrew (02:32:57-02:32:59): And you can do that every time.
Bryan (02:33:00-02:33:01): Do what?
Andrew (02:33:01-02:33:03): You as the designer.
Andrew (02:33:04-02:33:14): So let's separate you designer you and project manager you project manager U does this designer you does Rhino.
Andrew (02:33:14-02:33:15): Am I wrong?
Andrew (02:33:15-02:33:16): Am I right?
Andrew (02:33:18-02:33:20): Because the designer can't make tasks.
Andrew (02:33:21-02:33:24): The designer knows how to draw, but he doesn't know how to make tasks.
Bryan (02:33:28-02:33:29): I would say that's not true in the field.
Bryan (02:33:30-02:33:37): In this field you have like project managers who are on drafting programs and they're reading plans and they're working in them.
Andrew (02:33:38-02:33:39): Okay, so.
Andrew (02:33:39-02:33:41): So you're okay with dictating that?
Bryan (02:33:42-02:33:44): Yeah, that's my current job.
Andrew (02:33:46-02:33:51): Okay, so then there's a series of tasks when that task list is complete.
Andrew (02:33:52-02:33:56): Okay, so when that task list is made, then you're ready for production.
Andrew (02:33:57-02:33:58): Yes, yes.
Andrew (02:33:58-02:34:00): So when that task is and all those other things.
Andrew (02:34:01-02:34:02): Okay, in.
Andrew (02:34:06-02:34:07): Oh no, hold on.
Andrew (02:34:08-02:34:09): That's for production.
Andrew (02:34:11-02:34:13): But sourcing can start.
Andrew (02:34:13-02:34:15): Do you want sourcing to start?
Andrew (02:34:15-02:34:16): At what level?
Bryan (02:34:16-02:34:17): Kind of new tandem.
Andrew (02:34:19-02:34:20): Yeah, boy.
Bryan (02:34:20-02:34:20): Sorry.
Andrew (02:34:22-02:34:24): He's definitely not done these three.
Andrew (02:34:24-02:34:25): Shaggy dead.
Andrew (02:34:25-02:34:26): One of them might be.
Andrew (02:34:35-02:34:35): Oh.
Bryan (02:34:40-02:34:43): The double sided one you're talking about the one in.
Andrew (02:34:43-02:34:44): Yeah.
Bryan (02:34:49-02:34:49): That guy.
Andrew (02:34:50-02:34:50): Stop.
Andrew (02:34:50-02:34:51): It looks familiar.
Bryan (02:34:59-02:35:00): That one is done.
Andrew (02:35:02-02:35:05): The double sided one is not okay.
Bryan (02:35:05-02:35:06): Because I ran.
Bryan (02:35:06-02:35:11): We ran out of SHIELD now if you open up the.
Bryan (02:35:11-02:35:12): The picture of the double sided one.
Andrew (02:35:13-02:35:13): Yes.
Andrew (02:35:13-02:35:14): I don't know.
Bryan (02:35:17-02:35:20): I believe I text you a picture that has more on it.
Andrew (02:35:20-02:35:21): Yeah.
Bryan (02:35:21-02:35:23): So that should be the file that's on there.
Andrew (02:35:30-02:35:31): It's working great.
Andrew (02:35:32-02:35:35): Like, compared to what it used to be.
Andrew (02:35:35-02:35:36): Oh yeah.
Andrew (02:35:37-02:35:39): Like he's coming in with references and like.
Andrew (02:35:39-02:35:42): Anyway, no.
Andrew (02:35:42-02:35:45): To go to sourcing, you don't need the job card yet.
Andrew (02:35:46-02:35:50): So you should be triggering sourcing per prior to starting work on this.
Andrew (02:35:50-02:35:51): Am I right?
Andrew (02:35:52-02:35:52): Right.
Bryan (02:35:52-02:35:54): Design and sourcing are going to kind of happen around the same time.
Bryan (02:35:54-02:35:55): Once money's in, we can buy stuff.
Andrew (02:35:55-02:35:56): But we don't know what's in.
Andrew (02:35:56-02:35:59): You won't know what materials until you finish drawing.
Bryan (02:35:59-02:36:01): But you won't know how many sheets.
Andrew (02:36:01-02:36:03): To order until you finish drawing.
Andrew (02:36:03-02:36:11): That's only so really it goes money in finish bible, get drawings, make bomb.
Andrew (02:36:12-02:36:14): And as soon as bomb is done, you can trigger sourcing.
Andrew (02:36:16-02:36:16): Right.
Andrew (02:36:16-02:36:21): Because nothing else matters after that for sourcing as a department.
Andrew (02:36:21-02:36:21): Right.
Andrew (02:36:22-02:36:25): So then once you're done with the BOM is your first priority.
Andrew (02:36:26-02:36:28): And then job cards come after that.
Andrew (02:36:28-02:36:33): Once job cards come in, you finish doing job cards, you can trigger this.
Andrew (02:36:37-02:36:37): Okay.
Andrew (02:36:38-02:36:46): So and then you make the overall cabinet card with the tasks.
Andrew (02:36:46-02:36:50): And then from those tasks they can make subtasks.
Andrew (02:36:52-02:36:52): Right?
Andrew (02:36:52-02:36:53): That's what we want.
Andrew (02:36:53-02:36:55): So let's say build cabinet.
Andrew (02:36:57-02:36:59): They can farm out a subtask.
Bryan (02:36:59-02:37:03): And on that cover sheet I can put all the details, make the crown.
Bryan (02:37:03-02:37:04): Don't make the crown, make the countertop.
Andrew (02:37:05-02:37:13): Okay, so but basically they can get their task and then inside that task they can create subtasks and assign that subtask in some way.
Andrew (02:37:13-02:37:14): Yeah.
Andrew (02:37:14-02:37:15): Okay, cool.
Andrew (02:37:18-02:37:21): In that subtask, what's in that subtask?
Andrew (02:37:22-02:37:22): What's.
Bryan (02:37:22-02:37:23): Because they're farming up.
Andrew (02:37:23-02:37:25): Yeah, just the notes.
Andrew (02:37:26-02:37:27): It's like super basic.
Andrew (02:37:27-02:37:29): They need to attach an image to it.
Bryan (02:37:29-02:37:30): I think it needs to be tied to.
Bryan (02:37:30-02:37:30): To.
Andrew (02:37:32-02:37:32): Yeah.
Bryan (02:37:32-02:37:34): If you could attach an image, that's fine.
Bryan (02:37:34-02:37:35): Like, so I could snap.
Andrew (02:37:35-02:37:44): If you're assigned a subtask, does it make the cabinet they're working on, all the files and everything for that cabinet visible to that person.
Bryan (02:37:47-02:37:48): Necessary.
Andrew (02:37:51-02:37:53): But you don't care if it happens or not?
Bryan (02:37:53-02:37:54): No.
Andrew (02:37:54-02:37:55): Okay, cool.
Bryan (02:37:55-02:37:56): That could be some of that.
Bryan (02:37:56-02:37:57): We could just try out and see.
Bryan (02:37:57-02:37:58): I don't think it'll be important.
Andrew (02:37:58-02:38:05): If I'm assigned to cut a door, then I should be able to access everything about that cabinet.
Andrew (02:38:05-02:38:06): I need to understand you're not.
Bryan (02:38:06-02:38:14): I think the subtest he's gonna farm out is gonna be mill me 17 pieces of maple at inch three quarter by an inch.
Bryan (02:38:15-02:38:17): It has nothing to do with cabinet.
Bryan (02:38:17-02:38:19): So he's gonna be farming out things like that.
Andrew (02:38:20-02:38:20): Okay, cool.
Andrew (02:38:20-02:38:22): So he's gonna be doing down to that granular level.
Andrew (02:38:23-02:38:24): Okay.
Andrew (02:38:24-02:38:29): How do I get him to be able to do that quickly and easily to make a cut list.
Bryan (02:38:30-02:38:35): So one of the things would be like if there was a cut list task template.
Bryan (02:38:35-02:38:38): Maybe it may be like a generic task.
Bryan (02:38:39-02:38:42): I think it just needs and I don't know, maybe it doesn't.
Bryan (02:38:43-02:38:49): I was thinking for progress of the job it would make sense if it was all tiles to what if it gets lost?
Bryan (02:38:49-02:38:50): What if a cab doesn't come in?
Bryan (02:38:50-02:38:53): How do we know that there's a task out there and what it's assigned to?
Bryan (02:38:53-02:38:57): So it just needs like a job assignment and a cabinet relationship.
Bryan (02:38:57-02:39:01): This is assigned to 25 friendship and it's cabinet B03.
Andrew (02:39:02-02:39:07): No it we do know because the task when he makes it is attached to master task.
Andrew (02:39:08-02:39:11): Levi can't sign off on a task is done unless he's ticked the boss.
Andrew (02:39:11-02:39:13): That's our task will be okay.
Andrew (02:39:13-02:39:13): Yeah.
Andrew (02:39:13-02:39:14): So.
Andrew (02:39:14-02:39:17): And it can also be tied to like payment structures too.
Andrew (02:39:17-02:39:24): So you understand and he understands that he finished his job or he hasn't finished his job.
Andrew (02:39:25-02:39:25): Right.
Andrew (02:39:30-02:39:34): We don't have the CNC workflow in here yet.
Andrew (02:39:34-02:39:35): But I can see it from the notes.
Andrew (02:39:36-02:39:45): No, but the actual workflow of taking this, like I need to make a place where all the CNC stuff is saved.
Andrew (02:39:45-02:39:45): Yeah.
Andrew (02:39:45-02:39:47): Installed and which is.
Bryan (02:39:47-02:39:48): So are you replacing the folders?
Andrew (02:39:49-02:39:50): Eventually, yeah.
Bryan (02:39:51-02:39:53): So it's in the folders for now.
Andrew (02:39:53-02:39:53): Yeah.
Andrew (02:39:53-02:39:54): Which is fine.
Andrew (02:39:54-02:39:55): But I'm just.
Andrew (02:39:55-02:40:03): I'm just saying in my mind all that notion stuff I need to transfer into our main database, that's a whole other thing.
Bryan (02:40:04-02:40:05): Yeah.
Andrew (02:40:05-02:40:11): I think I have enough to populate to get you.
Andrew (02:40:11-02:40:12): So what I might do.
Andrew (02:40:12-02:40:15): The thing that's been dragging my time is the annotate the drawing thing.
Andrew (02:40:15-02:40:19): The nice thing I'm building, but I think I already have up and running.
Andrew (02:40:19-02:40:22): I start to change the fields now is to give you the pictureless version.
Andrew (02:40:23-02:40:25): Not pictureless as in like you can't attach files.
Andrew (02:40:25-02:40:29): It's more like the ability to automatically group and stuff.
Andrew (02:40:29-02:40:32): I should just give you the bare bones of like making a new project.
Andrew (02:40:33-02:40:35): Adding a cabinet here in the field.
Andrew (02:40:35-02:40:36): I'm dropping a PDF.
Andrew (02:40:37-02:40:40): Yeah, I can probably give that tomorrow.
Bryan (02:40:41-02:40:42): Well, I have this job.
Bryan (02:40:42-02:40:43): Thank you that I gotta start running with.
Bryan (02:40:43-02:40:45): So I haven't touched it intentionally.
Andrew (02:40:45-02:40:46): Okay.
Andrew (02:40:48-02:40:51): What I might do tomorrow's gonna.
Andrew (02:40:51-02:40:52): You all can say this tomorrow.
Andrew (02:40:52-02:40:57): So when do you want to build Sankadale?
Bryan (02:40:59-02:41:04): So what I really needed to do today was I have to train Alina starting Monday.
Bryan (02:41:04-02:41:05): So I wanted to, like, make job.
Andrew (02:41:05-02:41:06): What's Elena's job?
Bryan (02:41:06-02:41:08): She's gonna be a McKenna level helper.
Andrew (02:41:08-02:41:09): Okay.
Bryan (02:41:09-02:41:11): And then I needed to figure out which.
Bryan (02:41:11-02:41:14): This is part of that for Sadie on Thursday.
Bryan (02:41:14-02:41:16): If there's something I can pitch to her for a job.
Andrew (02:41:17-02:41:18): So we know what Sadie's job is.
Andrew (02:41:19-02:41:23): Sadie does purchase orders, ordering, and she does.
Andrew (02:41:29-02:41:30): General inventory and purchase management.
Andrew (02:41:31-02:41:32): Purchasing.
Andrew (02:41:32-02:41:33): She's in purchasing.
Bryan (02:41:34-02:41:36): Aiden is going to do the inventory.
Andrew (02:41:36-02:41:39): Aiden is doing warehouse and which is.
Bryan (02:41:39-02:41:40): Moving things around, which we said.
Andrew (02:41:40-02:41:41): Like here on the floor.
Andrew (02:41:41-02:41:42): Yeah, he's doing that.
Andrew (02:41:42-02:41:43): The count.
Andrew (02:41:43-02:41:44): He's doing that.
Andrew (02:41:44-02:41:46): But Sadie makes the Goldwood decision.
Andrew (02:41:46-02:41:47): Decision to order or not to buy.
Andrew (02:41:47-02:41:48): Aiden just does the.
Andrew (02:41:49-02:41:50): Hey, this is what we have.
Bryan (02:41:51-02:41:52): So he's doing accounting.
Andrew (02:41:52-02:41:53): Yes.
Bryan (02:41:53-02:41:54): She has a.
Andrew (02:41:54-02:42:02): She has the global understanding of what's in stock, what's not what we need, which means she also needs an understanding of like, the pipeline.
Andrew (02:42:03-02:42:04): That's what she would do.
Andrew (02:42:04-02:42:06): But her main thing is she's in purchasing.
Andrew (02:42:06-02:42:08): If she's doing two to four hours.
Bryan (02:42:08-02:42:12): A week and she can do something, well, she won't need to do payroll.
Andrew (02:42:12-02:42:13): Purchasing and payroll.
Andrew (02:42:13-02:42:13): Yeah.
Andrew (02:42:17-02:42:20): Which means we need to start to build out our vendor lists.
Bryan (02:42:20-02:42:22): She could do accounting too, eventually.
Andrew (02:42:22-02:42:22): Yeah.
Andrew (02:42:23-02:42:25): So she's basically doing the opposite thing.
Andrew (02:42:25-02:42:26): But we.
Andrew (02:42:26-02:42:28): What things we don't need or don't have?
Andrew (02:42:28-02:42:30): We don't have a vendor list right now.
Andrew (02:42:32-02:42:33): You have them on email.
Andrew (02:42:33-02:42:34): You know who they are.
Andrew (02:42:34-02:42:37): But we don't have an official company documentation.
Andrew (02:42:38-02:42:39): So that's a task she has to do right away.
Andrew (02:42:39-02:42:40): Build up vendor list.
Andrew (02:42:42-02:42:44): Then she has to know who the points of contact are.
Andrew (02:42:44-02:42:45): You have to talk to her about that.
Andrew (02:42:45-02:42:46): This is who we talk to.
Andrew (02:42:46-02:42:48): This is what you need to know about this place.
Andrew (02:42:49-02:42:51): She has to keep a ledger of that.
Andrew (02:42:52-02:42:55): And this is where we order our hardware.
Andrew (02:42:55-02:42:58): She has to, like, find the most efficient ways to do that.
Andrew (02:42:58-02:43:01): Not be doing these crazy Amazon orders that we're doing on time.
Andrew (02:43:01-02:43:01): So that's.
Andrew (02:43:01-02:43:02): That's already a job in itself.
Andrew (02:43:03-02:43:04): So she's going to do purchasing.
Andrew (02:43:04-02:43:09): Payroll, I think purchasing and payroll.
Andrew (02:43:09-02:43:10): And then.
Andrew (02:43:10-02:43:14): And then inventory management is like not to take all of the time.
Andrew (02:43:15-02:43:17): Same day, both of their time.
Andrew (02:43:18-02:43:20): Aiden's going to be on the floor and reporting To Sadie.
Andrew (02:43:20-02:43:22): Aiden is under Sadie.
Andrew (02:43:23-02:43:23): Yeah.
Andrew (02:43:26-02:43:27): So Aiden's jobs.
Andrew (02:43:27-02:43:29): Let me clarify Sarah, role that you have.
Andrew (02:43:29-02:43:40): Aidan's job is making sure that every project has its bom and knows can see the overall timeline and is prepped for that.
Andrew (02:43:41-02:43:51): So if he sees something in design then he's starting to do the organization of making sure everything is in order on that front and anything that's missing he goes to stadium for.
Andrew (02:43:54-02:43:57): And Sadie should have a weekly meeting with you that reports.
Andrew (02:43:57-02:43:58): These are the things, these are the orders.
Andrew (02:43:58-02:44:00): Are we all green lit?
Andrew (02:44:06-02:44:06): Yeah.
Andrew (02:44:06-02:44:07): What am I missing?
Andrew (02:44:16-02:44:18): I think we should just try just being a height.
Andrew (02:44:18-02:44:20): I know we're missing this world here.
Bryan (02:44:22-02:44:25): And I'm not even concerned about that necessarily yet.
Andrew (02:44:26-02:44:30): It's like who's taking quotes, who's taking inquiries, who's handling that?
Andrew (02:44:30-02:44:31): That's all you right now.
Andrew (02:44:32-02:44:35): So you'll still have to do that because you're the expert on that.
Andrew (02:44:35-02:44:37): But that's fine as long as you know it's.
Andrew (02:44:37-02:44:40): You have the way that you have to hand information.
Andrew (02:44:47-02:44:51): That page I showed you where you just press plus and you add a cabinet.
Andrew (02:44:51-02:44:53): Press plus, you add that.
Andrew (02:44:54-02:44:56): That's going to work just fine for you, right?
Andrew (02:44:56-02:44:57): For now, I think so.
Andrew (02:45:04-02:45:09): And I know the thing that I wanted to give you too was that global picture.
Andrew (02:45:09-02:45:14): But I just want to give you like the working project management first.
Andrew (02:45:14-02:45:20): We worry about it because it's not knowing how many projects are in this month.
Andrew (02:45:20-02:45:24): You can see by other ways of like hey, I see four projects on the list.
Andrew (02:45:24-02:45:25): This one's currently in process.
Andrew (02:45:26-02:45:30): Like you don't need the actual pre calculated thing immediately, right?
Andrew (02:45:30-02:45:31): It's not the most urgent.
Andrew (02:45:34-02:45:35): You get what I'm saying?
Andrew (02:45:35-02:45:36): You can work that out.
Andrew (02:45:36-02:45:45): But seeing the job list without me telling you, hey, you're at capacity, you know that's a kind of like a nice to have, right?
Andrew (02:45:51-02:46:01): Yeah, I can probably when I get back tonight finish building out the specs that we just recorded for cabinets, doors, all that kind of stuff.
Andrew (02:46:01-02:46:03): And I was give you the link.
Bryan (02:46:03-02:46:05): So I still have to band aid.
Andrew (02:46:05-02:46:06): What's the band aid?
Bryan (02:46:07-02:46:08): How do I make job grades?
Andrew (02:46:15-02:46:23): No, I think what I can do is once you've made it here in the system, you've made all the tasks and stuff, then I can make an export.
Andrew (02:46:25-02:46:27): Yeah, but that's.
Andrew (02:46:27-02:46:30): Let me, let me look at that.
Andrew (02:46:30-02:46:35): I don't think that's that crazy, but let me make sure that you can make tasks and stuff correctly first.
Andrew (02:46:39-02:46:46): But the thing that I want to say is like this is the process that's been defined.
Andrew (02:46:48-02:46:52): If this process is how it is, what's wrong with it?
Bryan (02:46:53-02:46:54): I don't know.
Andrew (02:46:55-02:46:57): Like we've talked through it, but like, no.
Andrew (02:46:57-02:47:00): Like, is there anything you currently can.
Andrew (02:47:00-02:47:04): I know, but is there anything currently that you see wrong with this process?
Andrew (02:47:05-02:47:05): I don't know.
Andrew (02:47:06-02:47:07): I don't know.
Bryan (02:47:07-02:47:10): I think we need to do it and I'm sure not wrong.
Bryan (02:47:10-02:47:11): I don't think wrong's the right word.
Andrew (02:47:11-02:47:12): I think adjustment.
Andrew (02:47:12-02:47:14): Yeah, yeah.
Bryan (02:47:15-02:47:19): Lax pressure lacks pressure is where it's going to happen in order to figure out how to get right.
Andrew (02:47:19-02:47:21): There are a few things I see as bottlenecks.
Andrew (02:47:21-02:47:25): The bottlenecks are people not making tasks.
Bryan (02:47:26-02:47:28): That's why you have to keep it simple.
Andrew (02:47:28-02:47:29): Yeah, I already know that.
Andrew (02:47:29-02:47:32): I'm already accounting for that in my brain as I'm designing things.
Andrew (02:47:34-02:47:36): But it's like still making someone do it.
Andrew (02:47:36-02:47:38): Like, I'll give you an example.
Andrew (02:47:38-02:47:42): The spreadsheet that we had for the first inventory count is changing a number.
Andrew (02:47:44-02:47:45): There's nothing complicated about.
Andrew (02:47:46-02:47:48): You go account, you change what the number is.
Bryan (02:47:48-02:47:49): But there's no structure to it either.
Bryan (02:47:50-02:47:52): When you do it, when do we start?
Andrew (02:47:52-02:47:53): And that's what I'm saying to you.
Andrew (02:47:54-02:47:56): That's the stuff that is process.
Andrew (02:47:57-02:47:57): Like what?
Andrew (02:47:58-02:47:58): There are two things.
Andrew (02:47:58-02:48:00): And that's what I was saying to you.
Andrew (02:48:00-02:48:01): In terms of the work that were doing.
Andrew (02:48:01-02:48:03): We've been working on process a lot.
Andrew (02:48:03-02:48:05): I'm working on building the product now.
Andrew (02:48:06-02:48:10): Now in the inventory thing, I built the method for you to do it, but we don't have a process.
Andrew (02:48:10-02:48:15): We didn't sell, say on Tuesdays at 10, can you go count this section?
Bryan (02:48:17-02:48:19): There's nothing to throttle what's coming in.
Andrew (02:48:19-02:48:20): Or going out 100%.
Andrew (02:48:21-02:48:25): But like we built the software or we built the method of entering in.
Andrew (02:48:25-02:48:33): It's how do we build a method that is usable and is defined and the difference between process work and product work.
Bryan (02:48:34-02:48:38): We don't have the bandwidth to work twice to do something just to try it.
Andrew (02:48:38-02:48:39): I know, yeah.
Bryan (02:48:39-02:48:47): So I think that's why it's like we need enough of it ready that will.
Bryan (02:48:47-02:48:49): The foundation won't be.
Andrew (02:48:49-02:48:54): But here's the thing is that there are two issues at hand here too.
Andrew (02:48:55-02:49:00): One is so inventory wise, the spreadsheet is enough to keep an accurate inventory.
Andrew (02:49:00-02:49:05): I built that in a way that is comprehensive and you change numbers, things, alerts.
Andrew (02:49:05-02:49:07): I built that all in there.
Andrew (02:49:08-02:49:12): It shouldn't fall on me.
Andrew (02:49:13-02:49:20): Apart from designing a better process to make that happen, where's the instruction how to use it.
Andrew (02:49:21-02:49:25): How to use a change a number on a spreadsheet that McKenna already did one time.
Andrew (02:49:27-02:49:28): Like that instruction happened.
Andrew (02:49:29-02:49:30): Yeah, but I'm just saying.
Andrew (02:49:30-02:49:40): I'm just saying McKenna did it one time and McKenna was explained and taught how to use a spreadsheet and given all the information for it.
Andrew (02:49:40-02:49:47): But I'm telling you that motivation and the enforcement of structure is not something I can design.
Bryan (02:49:49-02:49:50): It's something you could outline.
Andrew (02:49:50-02:49:51): Yeah.
Andrew (02:49:51-02:49:53): And it was outlined to the person.
Andrew (02:49:53-02:49:54): But we.
Andrew (02:49:54-02:49:57): Then it was when we did it.
Andrew (02:49:57-02:49:58): Yeah.
Bryan (02:49:58-02:50:02): I have no idea when she's supposed to do it, how it was supposed to happen.
Andrew (02:50:02-02:50:03): Right, right.
Andrew (02:50:03-02:50:04): But we didn't discuss that.
Andrew (02:50:04-02:50:08): The problem at the time was like, hey, Andrew, like we need a way to track out inventory.
Andrew (02:50:09-02:50:10): Cool.
Andrew (02:50:10-02:50:22): Built the method, built the tech and the product, but we didn't build a maintainable routine and standards of procedure on how to do inventory.
Andrew (02:50:22-02:50:28): So like with this is the standard of procedure here.
Andrew (02:50:29-02:50:33): I am working on the product that will make this work.
Andrew (02:50:34-02:50:36): And we just have to.
Andrew (02:50:36-02:50:41): For each of these steps, we actually need to document a process.
Andrew (02:50:42-02:50:42): We need this.
Andrew (02:50:43-02:50:46): This is how this business works on at every level.
Andrew (02:50:47-02:50:52): So that entire CMT conversation really would have loved to have documented it, but I was late.
Andrew (02:50:52-02:50:53): Sorry.
Andrew (02:50:53-02:51:08): But you know what I mean, like, even if I build all this software out and I built it as intuitively as possible, the willpower to do it is something that I'm gonna need help with.
Bryan (02:51:09-02:51:12): I think you're talking about the same handicap I'm feeling right now.
Bryan (02:51:12-02:51:15): I have these things in front of me that I don't know how to use.
Bryan (02:51:15-02:51:17): I don't know where they are, I.
Andrew (02:51:17-02:51:17): Don'T know what they are.
Andrew (02:51:18-02:51:21): So I need to work on the TCS Bible.
Andrew (02:51:22-02:51:23): That's the.
Andrew (02:51:23-02:51:26): That's one of the tasks that you actually need as a company.
Andrew (02:51:26-02:51:27): You need it the whole time.
Andrew (02:51:28-02:51:31): Which is a manual on how each phase works.
Andrew (02:51:31-02:51:33): What is the step by step on how to do it.
Andrew (02:51:33-02:51:37): If you get hit by a bus, the manual can tell you what to do.
Andrew (02:51:38-02:51:41): You have enough experts on hand for domain specific information.
Andrew (02:51:41-02:51:46): That is carpentry, the rest of the business stuff.
Andrew (02:51:46-02:51:48): These are our vendor lists.
Andrew (02:51:49-02:51:50): Hey, you're not here.
Andrew (02:51:50-02:51:51): The baby's happening.
Andrew (02:51:51-02:51:58): And we have a job that everyone else can keep working because this person knows we need more sheet goods.
Andrew (02:51:58-02:52:00): Here is the vendor list for them.
Andrew (02:52:00-02:52:01): We just call and we'll order it.
Andrew (02:52:01-02:52:02): Will you approve it?
Andrew (02:52:02-02:52:03): And done.
Andrew (02:52:03-02:52:05): But right now everything is still in you.
Andrew (02:52:06-02:52:15): So progressively one of the jobs which can be Assigned to allocate a couple hours of the week to work with me on.
Andrew (02:52:15-02:52:17): Systematically going is documenting.
Andrew (02:52:18-02:52:20): That's something from day one.
Andrew (02:52:21-02:52:24): So, like, yeah, what does it mean?
Andrew (02:52:25-02:52:26): What is the job summary?
Andrew (02:52:27-02:52:28): What is the definition of it?
Andrew (02:52:28-02:52:29): How do we do it?
Andrew (02:52:29-02:52:31): Where do I get the information from?
Andrew (02:52:31-02:52:32): All of it.
Andrew (02:52:32-02:52:35): So, yeah, it depends on what you want.
Andrew (02:52:35-02:52:36): Like, I'm one person.
Andrew (02:52:36-02:52:38): So, like, I want it simple.
Andrew (02:52:38-02:52:39): Yeah, I'm not talking.
Andrew (02:52:39-02:52:41): I'm not talking about, like, I'm one.
Andrew (02:52:42-02:52:46): It's far often more complicated to make simple.
Bryan (02:52:47-02:52:48): I know.
Andrew (02:52:49-02:52:53): It's like if you ask me, and this is the thing I tell you all the time, it's very easy to do a task.
Andrew (02:52:54-02:52:57): It's very easy to answer a question.
Bryan (02:52:58-02:53:00): How you have it.
Bryan (02:53:00-02:53:01): Like defining a cabinet.
Bryan (02:53:01-02:53:02): We don't have in my mind.
Bryan (02:53:02-02:53:04): We don't have to go any further than that.
Bryan (02:53:04-02:53:05): Once the cabinets got a name, we're done.
Andrew (02:53:05-02:53:12): But I do need to know what is a pass fail for a complete document.
Andrew (02:53:12-02:53:16): I do need to know what is a pass fail for a dwg.
Andrew (02:53:16-02:53:19): I need to know what a pass fail is for an adequate.
Andrew (02:53:19-02:53:20): For the scene.
Andrew (02:53:20-02:53:23): I need to know that there's correct tools.
Andrew (02:53:23-02:53:24): There's tools in here.
Andrew (02:53:24-02:53:24): I need.
Andrew (02:53:25-02:53:27): Like all that stuff needs to be said.
Bryan (02:53:28-02:53:29): It doesn't have to.
Andrew (02:53:29-02:53:30): No, it.
Andrew (02:53:30-02:53:31): It doesn't.
Andrew (02:53:31-02:53:32): It does have to.
Andrew (02:53:32-02:53:34): It doesn't have to if you know it.
Andrew (02:53:34-02:53:35): It does have to.
Andrew (02:53:35-02:53:37): If Shane quits tomorrow.
Andrew (02:53:38-02:53:40): What's true if Shane quits tomorrow, we're not.
Andrew (02:53:40-02:53:42): Well, that's not what I mean.
Andrew (02:53:42-02:53:45): But like, if you quit tomorrow, and that's the thing.
Bryan (02:53:45-02:53:54): Like, if at this position, if it stays the same, that's okay, but it doesn't.
Andrew (02:53:54-02:53:59): Because trot might flop, which we already talked about, you know, and I haven't.
Bryan (02:53:59-02:54:00): Worked with him, like, for many years.
Bryan (02:54:00-02:54:01): And were okay.
Andrew (02:54:03-02:54:05): Yeah, but like, we can keep it small business.
Andrew (02:54:05-02:54:08): I get what you're saying either way, because you're.
Bryan (02:54:08-02:54:10): You're coming back and saying, I'm one person.
Bryan (02:54:10-02:54:11): This is too much work.
Bryan (02:54:11-02:54:13): And I'm trying to, like, dial all that.
Andrew (02:54:13-02:54:21): No, I'm just saying we need to document and we need to write down, like, you know, how businesses like KFC, McDonald's survive and have thrived.
Andrew (02:54:21-02:54:29): I'm not talking about us getting into that scale, but when I worked at kfc, how I opened the lid to the fryer was defined.
Andrew (02:54:29-02:54:38): It was defined, like, I had to wait this period, amount of time I had this many turns, the weight that I was allowed to carry, how to stack this how to do that?
Bryan (02:54:38-02:54:40): It's not necessary.
Andrew (02:54:40-02:54:45): No, it is necessary, but not in one bite.
Andrew (02:54:46-02:54:49): Just do it as we're going.
Andrew (02:54:49-02:54:53): Like, hey, once I've worked out that process, I'm just gonna say how to do it?
Andrew (02:54:54-02:54:56): How do you write a proposal?
Andrew (02:54:56-02:55:10): Because there will be a day that you can't write the proposal and I'll have to do it or I am doing it now or like how I do it or if we have a salesperson come in and you can't be here.
Andrew (02:55:10-02:55:27): Like all the hours you took this morning training Shane, it had been documented would have been Shane reading or Shane watching a video or I'm not talking about doing any advanced or fancy things but at some level there needs to be this is TCS report.
Andrew (02:55:29-02:55:30): Like it's doable.
Andrew (02:55:30-02:55:37): And I know you think like, oh hey, like everybody knows how to do that or like that's not something that needs to be explained.
Andrew (02:55:37-02:55:45): But it is if like I'm like for example today I don't know what scribes are, I don't know what this is.
Andrew (02:55:45-02:55:52): And there are things that when you were talking to me it's like everybody knows the answer to that but like I don't and I'm the one building the system.
Andrew (02:55:52-02:56:08): And there could be a time when someone's purchasing something or someone's deciding if we need or don't need something and they have no reference and they're going to make that mistake and it's going to cost money, it's going to cost time and it's already happened so many times and that's from lack of having a unified resource.
Andrew (02:56:08-02:56:15): So that's something that's been done as like a secondary task but like moving forward.
Andrew (02:56:15-02:56:16): I know what I have to get done right away.
Andrew (02:56:17-02:56:19): What's the second thing I have to get done?
Andrew (02:56:22-02:56:22): I don't know.
Andrew (02:56:23-02:56:28): So I know what I have to do in terms of like get you the this next project.
Andrew (02:56:29-02:56:35): So you and I are going to sit and spec out project and get it through these two phases together.
Andrew (02:56:35-02:56:35): Okay.
Andrew (02:56:36-02:56:39): And then we're going to get the output is the job card from here.
Andrew (02:56:40-02:56:40): Okay.
Andrew (02:56:40-02:56:44): And I think that's part, that's when do that on Monday.
Bryan (02:56:45-02:56:47): I gotta train Alina.
Bryan (02:56:47-02:56:48): Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday.
Andrew (02:56:48-02:56:50): When are you gonna spec out the job?
Andrew (02:56:50-02:56:52): When are you planning on doing it?
Bryan (02:56:57-02:56:58): Maybe Monday afternoon.
Andrew (02:56:58-02:57:01): Actually I'll spec it out on my own.
Bryan (02:57:02-02:57:03): I would like to do it.
Andrew (02:57:03-02:57:07): No, no, what I'm saying is that already in the folder somewhere?
Andrew (02:57:09-02:57:09): Probably not.
Andrew (02:57:10-02:57:11): Just send it to me.
Bryan (02:57:11-02:57:12): So that's the whole thing too.
Bryan (02:57:12-02:57:13): Like make the folder.
Andrew (02:57:15-02:57:15): No, I'm.
Andrew (02:57:15-02:57:24): What I'm saying is I'll take that file and I already on my own should be able to get to the point of like defining all the cabinets and runs and stuff.
Andrew (02:57:26-02:57:27): And you can change it later.
Andrew (02:57:27-02:57:32): But like I can say there's an upper, there's a lower, there's a base, there's four bases, there's three cabinets.
Andrew (02:57:34-02:57:36): Just a move past the text.
Andrew (02:57:47-02:57:49): Okay, so just clarifying something linear.
Andrew (02:57:49-02:57:49): 3.
Andrew (02:57:51-02:57:53): It's just literally from here to here.
Andrew (02:57:54-02:57:54): That's it.
Andrew (02:57:55-02:58:04): And then if it's a base and if there's something stacked on top of it, then I double it and then if it a full, then it's a double automatically.
Andrew (02:58:04-02:58:06): Any other things on simplicity of math there?
Bryan (02:58:13-02:58:16): If it's a paneled appliance, we include it.
Andrew (02:58:17-02:58:19): Oh, so we count that as file linear fee.
Andrew (02:58:19-02:58:20): Mm.
Andrew (02:58:20-02:58:20): Okay.
Bryan (02:58:22-02:58:23): If it's not panel, we don't.
Andrew (02:58:25-02:58:26): Okay, cool.
Andrew (02:58:30-02:58:36): That means that if I'm right, an idiot can price out the new feet.
Andrew (02:58:38-02:58:40): So you don't have to do that technically.
Andrew (02:58:44-02:58:45): Okay, cool.
Andrew (02:58:47-02:58:48): All right.
Andrew (02:58:51-02:58:52): Yeah, that's it.
Andrew (02:58:57-02:58:58): What are you still worried about?
Andrew (02:58:59-02:59:05): Like in terms of what else I need to do, this is just very.
Bryan (02:59:05-02:59:06): Different from what I expected.
Bryan (02:59:06-02:59:09): Like I thought were going to like kind of work through some of the things I thought I was going.
Andrew (02:59:09-02:59:11): To get ready for this job.
Andrew (02:59:11-02:59:12): Yeah.
Andrew (02:59:12-02:59:12): Training.
Andrew (02:59:13-02:59:13): Oh, okay.
Andrew (02:59:13-02:59:15): So let's talk about that while.
Andrew (02:59:15-02:59:16): I mean, what are we going to do?
Bryan (02:59:16-02:59:17): So Lena's starting on Monday.
Bryan (02:59:17-02:59:19): She's on a three week trial.
Bryan (02:59:19-02:59:25): She has a plus level helper skill set.
Bryan (02:59:26-02:59:28): She needs to be trained on how we do things here.
Bryan (02:59:29-02:59:31): I made a list of like tasks that I'm going to do with her.
Andrew (02:59:32-02:59:32): What are the tasks?
Bryan (02:59:33-02:59:34): Floating shelves.
Bryan (02:59:34-02:59:38): Crown 2 by 2 blocks for pull outs.
Bryan (02:59:38-02:59:44): 3 inch cabinet rips, edge banding assembly cabinet.
Andrew (02:59:45-02:59:48): So this is the way to handle that.
Andrew (02:59:48-02:59:49): Is it?
Andrew (02:59:49-02:59:51): Is a how.
Andrew (02:59:51-02:59:53): How do you plan on teaching it?
Bryan (02:59:53-02:59:54): Hands on.
Andrew (02:59:54-02:59:55): And then what?
Andrew (02:59:55-02:59:59): So like talk me through just a quick like idea of how.
Andrew (02:59:59-03:00:00): The simplest lesson that you have.
Andrew (03:00:01-03:00:02): Just talk me through how we're gonna do it.
Andrew (03:00:02-03:00:04): So I'm coming in.
Andrew (03:00:04-03:00:05): Pick the simplest tasks.
Bryan (03:00:05-03:00:06): Floating shelves.
Andrew (03:00:06-03:00:07): Okay, so tell me about that.
Bryan (03:00:07-03:00:09): I was gonna print out a task card.
Bryan (03:00:09-03:00:10): Floating shelves.
Bryan (03:00:10-03:00:13): Write down all the steps for and then do each one.
Bryan (03:00:13-03:00:20): Pick the lumber, plane it, square it, join it, glue up on the glue rack, sand it down.
Bryan (03:00:21-03:00:22): Qc.
Andrew (03:00:22-03:00:23): You were going to demonstrate it.
Andrew (03:00:23-03:00:24): Okay.
Andrew (03:00:24-03:00:26): And then when was she going to try and do it.
Bryan (03:00:26-03:00:27): We have to do two of them.
Andrew (03:00:27-03:00:28): Okay.
Andrew (03:00:28-03:00:29): And then.
Andrew (03:00:30-03:00:31): Okay, so three stages.
Andrew (03:00:31-03:00:34): Demonstrate, document.
Andrew (03:00:34-03:00:35): That's how she's going to look.
Andrew (03:00:36-03:00:36): So once she.
Andrew (03:00:37-03:00:40): So while that process is happening, she should keep a voice note.
Andrew (03:00:40-03:00:41): So that happens.
Andrew (03:00:42-03:00:44): So that I have that voice note.
Andrew (03:00:44-03:00:45): But she.
Andrew (03:00:45-03:00:50): From a learning point of view, her documenting it so it's learnable.
Andrew (03:00:50-03:00:54): I have a template for her to fill in on how to do something.
Andrew (03:00:54-03:00:55): So I'll send that to you later today.
Andrew (03:00:55-03:00:56): I already have it.
Andrew (03:00:57-03:00:58): It's literally a.
Andrew (03:00:58-03:00:59): It's like a job card.
Andrew (03:00:59-03:01:01): It's just a step sheet where she.
Andrew (03:01:01-03:01:03): She could write step one, step two.
Andrew (03:01:03-03:01:07): Now tell me how I could modify that and what you would want that to look like.
Bryan (03:01:08-03:01:09): I don't know what it looks like.
Andrew (03:01:09-03:01:09): Like.
Andrew (03:01:09-03:01:12): Think of it like a recipe card for the job.
Bryan (03:01:12-03:01:13): You just described the job card.
Andrew (03:01:14-03:01:16): That card only has.
Andrew (03:01:16-03:01:17): Doesn't have a step by step.
Bryan (03:01:17-03:01:18): It does.
Andrew (03:01:18-03:01:19): Oh, and this top corner.
Andrew (03:01:19-03:01:19): Yeah.
Andrew (03:01:21-03:01:24): I don't want you to pre write it unless you want to pre write.
Andrew (03:01:28-03:01:32): She has to be able to articulate like her schedule of learning should be.
Andrew (03:01:32-03:01:34): A part of it is you demonstrating it.
Andrew (03:01:34-03:01:39): A part of her is doing it and then writing it down and reviewing.
Andrew (03:01:39-03:01:41): Unless you're gonna watch her do it.
Bryan (03:01:41-03:01:43): Yeah, I'm doing it with her.
Andrew (03:01:43-03:01:46): So you're gonna do each step at the same time together.
Andrew (03:01:46-03:01:47): Okay.
Andrew (03:01:47-03:01:49): Because she needs to like.
Andrew (03:01:49-03:01:52): Part of that reinforcement is writing down and we need her written down.
Andrew (03:01:52-03:01:56): So if you're already doing that, then we're already gonna make the training period.
Bryan (03:01:57-03:01:58): I was gonna write it down.
Bryan (03:01:58-03:01:59): All the test cards.
Andrew (03:02:01-03:02:03): She still has to write something.
Andrew (03:02:03-03:02:05): Put like the methodology down.
Andrew (03:02:06-03:02:07): Your task cards need to be simple.
Andrew (03:02:10-03:02:13): That's how I would train, if that's what you're asking.
Andrew (03:02:13-03:02:15): Yeah, that's the most effective way.
Bryan (03:02:15-03:02:18): So just put down the task and just have her fill it out as we're going.
Bryan (03:02:19-03:02:20): Okay.
Andrew (03:02:22-03:02:26): It saves you all work and then writes it in a language that she understands and not.
Andrew (03:02:26-03:02:27): It's not about you.
Bryan (03:02:28-03:02:29): Okay.
Andrew (03:02:29-03:02:29): What.
Andrew (03:02:29-03:02:31): What else is there that you need help with Her.
Andrew (03:02:36-03:02:41): What I would say lesson one is explain this to her.
Andrew (03:02:42-03:02:43): This column.
Andrew (03:02:43-03:02:44): How we do things.
Andrew (03:02:45-03:02:47): So first thing for her.
Andrew (03:02:47-03:02:47): Welcome.
Andrew (03:02:49-03:02:53): Explain our stage process and then go.
Andrew (03:02:53-03:02:54): This is what.
Andrew (03:02:54-03:02:57): This is where you come into the picture in this production column.
Andrew (03:02:57-03:02:58): So you'll receive a.
Andrew (03:02:59-03:03:03): Or one of the team will ask you to do a specific task.
Andrew (03:03:04-03:03:11): But in your first few days, I'm going to teach you a few fundamentals and a few basic tasks that really happen all the time.
Andrew (03:03:12-03:03:15): So here I've made up a job card for it.
Andrew (03:03:15-03:03:18): Here is the section you'll fill in as you're watching me do it.
Andrew (03:03:18-03:03:23): Fill in the task and then we're gonna both do the same task and we're gonna work through it.
Andrew (03:03:23-03:03:30): By the end of the day I'd like you to re explain to me how to do the process done.
Andrew (03:03:31-03:03:36): So what you can expect every time you come in is your hype a job cop.
Andrew (03:03:36-03:03:37): And this is how you will.
Bryan (03:03:38-03:03:39): I mean I think it sounds so great.
Andrew (03:03:39-03:03:40): I just.
Bryan (03:03:40-03:03:44): We're not at that point to have give her a job card every day.
Bryan (03:03:44-03:03:46): That's, that's an expectation that's going to fall flat.
Bryan (03:03:46-03:03:47): It's like the inventory thing.
Bryan (03:03:47-03:03:48): We're not ready for it.
Andrew (03:03:49-03:03:51): We're not ready to like maintain it.
Andrew (03:03:51-03:03:52): What do you expect her to do?
Bryan (03:03:52-03:03:56): Every day she's gonna come in and report to Shaggy and Levi and figure out what to do.
Andrew (03:04:00-03:04:01): That's fine.
Andrew (03:04:01-03:04:03): So you can just tell that you can be like, hey.
Andrew (03:04:03-03:04:04): So two ways you'll get tasks.
Andrew (03:04:04-03:04:14): A, you know, we're a small business, it's going to be versatile but you'll either get specific tasks that's already been assigned, that's pre allocated to a project and this is the proper way.
Andrew (03:04:14-03:04:30): But they're like any small business you're going to have to be on hand and ready to go with whatever and they will make sure to explain to you what that is and eventually just the subtask, you'll get a subtask list.
Andrew (03:04:30-03:04:30): And that's.
Andrew (03:04:31-03:04:32): It's not.
Andrew (03:04:32-03:04:33): Yeah, it's easy.
Andrew (03:04:34-03:04:45): I think just having her understand that firstly understanding how this system works, understanding how the system where she fits in the thing, how to do quality control.
Andrew (03:04:46-03:04:58): Something I would train her is in like how you should do this during your training process is you must explain how to check like what is good, what is bad.
Andrew (03:04:58-03:04:59): How do I check when I'm done?
Andrew (03:04:59-03:05:00): That's right.
Andrew (03:05:00-03:05:08): Teach her right up front how to check against a drawing or check against a plan or check against something.
Andrew (03:05:08-03:05:10): And that is a step you do every time.
Andrew (03:05:10-03:05:13): Not just cut me this piece, go and cut it and bring it to somebody.
Andrew (03:05:13-03:05:18): That part of that process is rechecking just to make sure that it's correct.
Andrew (03:05:18-03:05:20): So if that's inculcated then that's great.
Andrew (03:05:20-03:05:23): That's probably the culture inculcation that is important.
Andrew (03:05:25-03:05:27): What else am I thinking of about her?
Bryan (03:05:27-03:05:29): Is there anything else, Brian?
Andrew (03:05:29-03:05:31): That's how I would do it at least.
Andrew (03:05:32-03:05:33): How many tasks do you have per day?
Andrew (03:05:33-03:05:35): Just One or like what's your plan?
Bryan (03:05:35-03:05:37): No, probably like six to eight.
Andrew (03:05:38-03:05:39): Six to eight in one day?
Andrew (03:05:41-03:05:42): Dude, that's a lot.
Andrew (03:05:43-03:05:43): Yeah.
Andrew (03:05:44-03:05:45): Do you think she's gonna like.
Andrew (03:05:45-03:05:46): Are you gonna adjust?
Bryan (03:05:46-03:05:48): Making a shelf is gonna take an hour.
Andrew (03:05:49-03:05:58): Yeah, but I do like, I'd ramp up.
Andrew (03:05:58-03:06:01): Do like a complicated and a couple small ones.
Andrew (03:06:01-03:06:05): A complicated, a big one and then a couple small ones or a couple small ones and then a big one.
Andrew (03:06:05-03:06:07): That will take her an afternoon to do.
Andrew (03:06:07-03:06:10): Don't like just sit flammable.
Andrew (03:06:11-03:06:12): Is there a sequence?
Andrew (03:06:12-03:06:13): Show me the toss.
Bryan (03:06:24-03:06:25): Who knows where it is?
Andrew (03:06:32-03:06:34): What's actually coming into Monday?
Andrew (03:06:35-03:06:35): Come in on Monday.
Andrew (03:06:36-03:06:40): I'll come in on Monday just to do the intro and then I'll leave the rest to you after that.
Bryan (03:06:40-03:06:43): Glue ups, domino lamel, cutting edge banding.
Bryan (03:06:44-03:06:47): I wanted her to maintain a shipping ledger.
Andrew (03:06:49-03:06:51): Maintain a shipping ledger, which is the.
Bryan (03:06:51-03:06:53): One we have on notion right now, which is our bol.
Bryan (03:06:53-03:06:58): Yeah, she's gonna make the bob cabinet two by two blocks.
Bryan (03:06:58-03:06:59): Publish shelves.
Andrew (03:06:59-03:07:00): Pup's crown.
Bryan (03:07:00-03:07:04): She's got a Route OG trim, like 70 linear feet of trim.
Andrew (03:07:04-03:07:06): Okay, so here's my plan.
Andrew (03:07:06-03:07:09): On Monday morning, what time is she coming in?
Bryan (03:07:09-03:07:11): She's going to do 8 to 4:30.
Andrew (03:07:11-03:07:12): 8 to 4:30.
Andrew (03:07:12-03:07:13): I think I'll take.
Andrew (03:07:17-03:07:19): I'll do 10 to 12.
Bryan (03:07:19-03:07:20): Okay.
Andrew (03:07:20-03:07:22): So 10 to 12 is with me.
Andrew (03:07:22-03:07:24): And I'm going to walk her through this.
Bryan (03:07:24-03:07:25): Okay.
Andrew (03:07:25-03:07:32): And I'm going to walk us through this and I'm gonna walk her through all of this stuff and then you can do whatever from 8 to 10 and then like after.
Andrew (03:07:32-03:07:32): That's all you'll see.
Andrew (03:07:32-03:07:39): But I'll take this two hours to get her up to speed so she knows in her mind where she's in the cock.
Andrew (03:07:39-03:07:40): So I'll cover that.
Andrew (03:07:40-03:07:45): Orientation timesheets.
Andrew (03:07:46-03:07:47): Yeah, I'll do that too.
Bryan (03:07:49-03:07:50): Because it needs to be changed to her name.
Andrew (03:07:52-03:07:53): Yeah, I'll show her how to report time.
Andrew (03:07:53-03:07:58): I'll do all the like the housework stuff.
Andrew (03:07:58-03:07:59): Yeah, I got it.
Bryan (03:07:59-03:07:59): Okay.
Andrew (03:07:59-03:08:03): Yeah, just worry about your part of that thing.
Andrew (03:08:03-03:08:09): So I would say prep those and prep how you're planning on teaching.
Andrew (03:08:09-03:08:14): But the three stages are watch, do, record.
Andrew (03:08:15-03:08:16): Okay.
Bryan (03:08:16-03:08:17): And she can record it by writing it down.
Bryan (03:08:18-03:08:19): I want voice recording.
Andrew (03:08:19-03:08:20): Yeah.
Bryan (03:08:22-03:08:27): Aiden, at some point, part of what he was going to do, was he going to be involved with detailing?
Bryan (03:08:28-03:08:30): We were supposed to talk today about if you had a plan for him.
Andrew (03:08:30-03:08:33): Yeah, it's he.
Bryan (03:08:33-03:08:34): Have you reached out to him?
Andrew (03:08:34-03:08:35): Yeah, he broke his foot.
Andrew (03:08:36-03:08:40): That's why he's yeah, his grandma.
Andrew (03:08:40-03:08:42): His grandma got cancer.
Andrew (03:08:42-03:08:43): They went to North Carolina.
Andrew (03:08:43-03:08:46): He broke his foot down, so that's why it's been quiet.
Andrew (03:08:46-03:08:47): I called him yesterday.
Bryan (03:08:47-03:08:47): Okay.
Andrew (03:08:47-03:08:48): Yeah.
Andrew (03:08:48-03:08:48): So.
Andrew (03:08:48-03:08:51): And this part, apart from the.
Andrew (03:08:51-03:08:58): The learning how to do how to read, that's on you on the skill level, teaching.
Andrew (03:08:58-03:09:02): But in terms of process and understanding his role and what he does.
Andrew (03:09:02-03:09:02): I got it.
Andrew (03:09:03-03:09:04): I got it covered.
Andrew (03:09:05-03:09:08): I mean, that's the part that I need from you.
Andrew (03:09:08-03:09:14): No, no, the part I need from you is like, how to read what you've done.
Andrew (03:09:15-03:09:16): He.
Bryan (03:09:16-03:09:21): The challenge I'm gonna face is he does not know construction and he does not know cabinets.
Bryan (03:09:21-03:09:22): And it's intrinsic to this role.
Andrew (03:09:22-03:09:23): Correct.
Andrew (03:09:23-03:09:26): But it's learnable.
Andrew (03:09:26-03:09:29): And it's learnable just for this, like.
Andrew (03:09:29-03:09:34): And the thing is, in this design phase, you've already done filled out the information for me.
Andrew (03:09:34-03:09:36): It's looking at it and going, okay.
Andrew (03:09:36-03:09:37): He said there's a door.
Andrew (03:09:37-03:09:38): He hasn't written that.
Andrew (03:09:38-03:09:40): What type of door it is.
Andrew (03:09:40-03:09:43): I need to go check with him to detail out all the specs.
Andrew (03:09:43-03:09:44): Okay.
Andrew (03:09:44-03:09:44): Yeah.
Andrew (03:09:44-03:09:46): He's kind of like your whole villa, Lo.
Andrew (03:09:46-03:09:48): You're doing it up here, which is good.
Andrew (03:09:48-03:09:49): Yeah.
Bryan (03:09:49-03:09:52): What is Sadie going to do starting not next week or the week after?
Andrew (03:09:52-03:09:52): Yeah.
Andrew (03:09:52-03:09:54): Sadie is going to.
Andrew (03:09:54-03:09:55): For the orders coming in.
Andrew (03:09:56-03:10:03): The first thing Sadie has to do is get her head around general inventory.
Andrew (03:10:03-03:10:04): Right.
Andrew (03:10:04-03:10:05): And what we have on hand and how.
Andrew (03:10:05-03:10:08): Well, Sadie needs this orientation, too.
Bryan (03:10:08-03:10:10): I really should do it with this with her.
Andrew (03:10:10-03:10:11): I should do it with.
Andrew (03:10:11-03:10:11): You need to.
Andrew (03:10:11-03:10:12): With each of them.
Andrew (03:10:12-03:10:12): Yeah.
Bryan (03:10:12-03:10:13): You can do it with her next Thursday.
Andrew (03:10:13-03:10:14): Yeah.
Bryan (03:10:14-03:10:15): In the afternoon.
Andrew (03:10:15-03:10:15): Yeah.
Bryan (03:10:15-03:10:16): Or no, probably the same time.
Andrew (03:10:17-03:10:18): So that's going to take up her entire time.
Andrew (03:10:19-03:10:21): It's getting Sadie up to speed.
Andrew (03:10:21-03:10:22): Yeah.
Andrew (03:10:23-03:10:29): And then once Sadie's up to speed, Sadie needs to work on collecting all the vendor information.
Andrew (03:10:29-03:10:30): That's her first task.
Andrew (03:10:33-03:10:34): Yeah.
Andrew (03:10:37-03:10:38): What else?
Bryan (03:10:39-03:10:42): So what time are you coming in on Monday?
Andrew (03:10:42-03:10:43): 10.
Andrew (03:10:43-03:10:44): Oh, just before 10.
Andrew (03:10:44-03:10:44): Yeah.
Bryan (03:10:45-03:10:48): When are you doing the sanity stuff?
Andrew (03:10:48-03:10:49): When do you want to do that?
Andrew (03:10:50-03:10:50): I'll do.
Andrew (03:10:50-03:10:52): I'll do it now because I'm going.
Bryan (03:10:52-03:10:52): To hit crisis mode.
Bryan (03:10:52-03:10:54): I'm going to start order on Monday.
Andrew (03:10:55-03:10:56): Oh, I'll have tomorrow then.
Bryan (03:10:56-03:10:57): Cuz I have.
Andrew (03:10:57-03:10:58): That is one that I'll do.
Andrew (03:10:58-03:10:59): Thank you.
Andrew (03:10:59-03:11:00): Tomorrow we would.
Bryan (03:11:00-03:11:03): We will not get past the time crunch.
Bryan (03:11:03-03:11:07): What we're creating is a good flow for regardless of time crunch.
Andrew (03:11:07-03:11:08): Okay.
Andrew (03:11:10-03:11:12): Please leave this board here the way it is until she gets in.
Bryan (03:11:12-03:11:12): Yeah.
Andrew (03:11:12-03:11:14): We take a picture for you, but I already did.
Andrew (03:11:15-03:11:19): Yeah, yeah.
Andrew (03:11:25-03:11:25): Cool.
Bryan (03:11:28-03:11:30): She will be really good too, at.
Bryan (03:11:30-03:11:32): I have no idea what I pay for consumables.
Bryan (03:11:32-03:11:33): I find something cheaper.
Bryan (03:11:34-03:11:34): Yeah.
Andrew (03:11:36-03:11:39): We don't even know what consumables we have or need.
Andrew (03:11:40-03:11:43): We don't have a master ledger of considerable.
Bryan (03:11:43-03:11:44): Isn't that what you put on your list?
Andrew (03:11:44-03:11:46): No, of like office consumables.
Bryan (03:11:46-03:11:47): Oh.
Andrew (03:11:48-03:11:51): Like office supplies, wipes, sponges.
Andrew (03:11:53-03:11:55): We have consumables, like screw bits.
Andrew (03:11:55-03:11:56): Yeah, Yeah.
Andrew (03:12:02-03:12:04): I think we're okay, Brian.
Andrew (03:12:05-03:12:05): I don't.
Bryan (03:12:05-03:12:06): I don't disagree.
Andrew (03:12:06-03:12:07): Yeah, it's.
Andrew (03:12:07-03:12:08): It's just still.
Bryan (03:12:08-03:12:10): I feel the same malleable.
Bryan (03:12:10-03:12:12): It's a great idea spot.
Bryan (03:12:12-03:12:16): And I'm still like, no.
Andrew (03:12:16-03:12:23): I think the thing that's hard for most, and we've discussed this, is you are only looking at.
Andrew (03:12:23-03:12:24): We don't have a product.
Bryan (03:12:25-03:12:35): I don't think so personally, because I feel like I have micro products in a proposal, an invoice, a time card.
Bryan (03:12:35-03:12:37): I can't even edit them.
Bryan (03:12:38-03:12:39): Like, I can't change Alina's name.
Andrew (03:12:40-03:12:40): Right.
Andrew (03:12:41-03:12:43): Well, yeah, so I think that's what.
Bryan (03:12:43-03:12:45): It's not that it's just like the end product.
Andrew (03:12:47-03:12:52): Well, like, technically you can just use a pencil, scratch it out and edit it.
Andrew (03:12:52-03:12:53): Yes.
Andrew (03:12:53-03:12:54): You don't have a digital.
Andrew (03:12:54-03:12:56): Yes, but I'm just saying, you know, we're not.
Andrew (03:13:02-03:13:06): Yeah, yeah, no, I get what you're saying.
Andrew (03:13:06-03:13:08): Like, the thing is there are always.
Andrew (03:13:09-03:13:12): You've been in the practice of workarounds for a long time, so.
Andrew (03:13:12-03:13:13): Yes.
Andrew (03:13:13-03:13:16): So could you do a proposal the old way?
Andrew (03:13:16-03:13:17): Yeah, you could.
Andrew (03:13:18-03:13:20): There's nothing stopping you from doing that.
Andrew (03:13:20-03:13:22): But the nice way and the clean way.
Andrew (03:13:23-03:13:24): Yeah, we don't have that yet.
Andrew (03:13:24-03:13:32): Now, like, parts of me, I even thinking in my mind, it's never gonna be as nice as how I'm doing it for you right now.
Bryan (03:13:33-03:13:33): That's okay.
Andrew (03:13:33-03:13:35): But that's not good, right?
Bryan (03:13:35-03:13:36): That's okay.
Andrew (03:13:36-03:13:38): It just needs to be what is going to be 100.
Andrew (03:13:38-03:13:43): Because the thing is, like, right now I'm using AI to like, build a custom one every single time.
Bryan (03:13:44-03:13:46): Which also sucks because they're always different.
Andrew (03:13:47-03:13:48): No, like the information different.
Andrew (03:13:48-03:13:50): The formats look the same.
Andrew (03:13:50-03:13:50): Now all the.
Andrew (03:13:50-03:13:51): Yeah, we got to that point.
Andrew (03:13:51-03:13:52): Yeah, yeah.
Andrew (03:13:52-03:13:53): All the invoices look the same.
Andrew (03:13:53-03:13:54): All the pros look the same.
Andrew (03:13:54-03:14:02): But like, for example, if there are five items versus four items, it can resize the page for me and do all the, like that stuff.
Andrew (03:14:02-03:14:07): Whereas, like, if we had a fixed format and it's this box, then it's gonna go to the Second page.
Andrew (03:14:07-03:14:10): Yeah, I know you don't care about that, but, like, those are just things.
Andrew (03:14:10-03:14:16): Like there are things that you don't care about that are still important even though you don't care about them.
Andrew (03:14:16-03:14:18): And I'm not saying that this is one of them.
Andrew (03:14:18-03:14:28): Just making that notion like there are other people from, for example, from a marketing point of view, it's going to affect a customer's opinion of us.
Andrew (03:14:28-03:14:44): If the invoice is broken in some way or it's not cleanly laid out, or every little inclination that we feel that it just lowers the price value, you know, mentally, you're like, oh, they sent me an invoice and it's got a weird cutoff on the bottom.
Andrew (03:14:45-03:14:49): Hey, a good company that has their business in order wouldn't do that.
Andrew (03:14:49-03:14:53): And the best example I use is, I think the Rolling Stones.
Andrew (03:14:53-03:14:54): Oh, no.
Andrew (03:14:54-03:14:55): Some crazy rock band.
Andrew (03:14:55-03:14:58): They always requested blue M&Ms.
Andrew (03:14:59-03:15:01): And we always make a joke.
Andrew (03:15:01-03:15:03): People always make a joke about that.
Andrew (03:15:03-03:15:10): But when they interviewed the person, he said, the blue M and Ms. Are buried 3/4 of the way down in our rider list.
Andrew (03:15:11-03:15:15): And if I come into the dressing room and there aren't blue M and Ms.
Andrew (03:15:15-03:15:24): There, I can be sure that they didn't pay attention to the rest of the rider, which is like safety things and like stage heights and all those kinds of things.
Andrew (03:15:25-03:15:28): So every little thing counts.
Andrew (03:15:28-03:15:29): It's just doing it the right way.
Andrew (03:15:29-03:15:31): But I know what needs to be done.
Andrew (03:15:31-03:15:38): But are there any other training things or what else I want we missing from your list of things that you wanted to get done today?
Bryan (03:15:39-03:15:44): I think working with Dagger today was a good step forward in trying to get his role a little bit more defined.
Bryan (03:15:44-03:15:45): Something off my plate.
Bryan (03:15:45-03:15:52): Yeah, I think trying to get Alina up to speed, which will take more off their plate, off my plate.
Bryan (03:15:52-03:15:55): Just not necessarily anything production wise.
Bryan (03:15:55-03:15:56): Just all the little stuff to make go away.
Bryan (03:15:58-03:16:00): And then figuring out what Sadie can.
Bryan (03:16:00-03:16:03): What sat role will be, if it's even needed.
Andrew (03:16:04-03:16:06): I think a couple hours from Sadie here on that.
Andrew (03:16:06-03:16:10): I think what you need is someone like me who is.
Andrew (03:16:10-03:16:11): You're okay with seeing the numbers.
Andrew (03:16:13-03:16:13): And that's.
Andrew (03:16:13-03:16:16): I think you need that person and that's Sadie.
Andrew (03:16:17-03:16:24): So any task that involves someone who's seeing the numbers, that has to go to someone like Sadie.
Andrew (03:16:29-03:16:36): So right now it's purchase orders, receiving deposits, following up on, not receiving deposits from customers if need be.
Andrew (03:16:37-03:16:39): All that is Sadie.
Andrew (03:16:40-03:16:44): Okay, cool, cool.
Andrew (03:16:45-03:16:47): I'll work on Sankity either when I get home.
Andrew (03:16:47-03:16:48): Or tomorrow.
Bryan (03:16:53-03:16:58): So I feel like I still truly don't know the line.
Bryan (03:16:58-03:16:59): I'm gonna write you a check.
Bryan (03:16:59-03:17:01): And I don't know the line.
Andrew (03:17:01-03:17:04): The thing is, Brian, neither one of us know the line.
Andrew (03:17:05-03:17:06): And it's never been.
Andrew (03:17:06-03:17:12): And the consulting has always just been the line is like, there are.
Andrew (03:17:12-03:17:13): There are targets.
Andrew (03:17:14-03:17:18): But it's just like, I just keep working.
Andrew (03:17:19-03:17:20): It's not a.
Andrew (03:17:20-03:17:23): Like, that's such a thankless job.
Andrew (03:17:24-03:17:26): Like, where do we draw this line?
Andrew (03:17:26-03:17:28): Like, how do It?
Andrew (03:17:28-03:17:31): You know, because it's like, yeah, I solved the.
Andrew (03:17:31-03:17:33): I can solve an inventory problem for you overnight.
Andrew (03:17:34-03:17:35): But did it solve the problem?
Andrew (03:17:35-03:17:36): No, not really.
Andrew (03:17:37-03:17:39): I just did the thing that was asked.
Andrew (03:17:39-03:17:43): And it's like continually working on refining a process.
Andrew (03:17:44-03:17:49): Like, I can tell you from the time that we started to now, it is night and day.
Bryan (03:17:51-03:17:51): It feels it.
Bryan (03:17:51-03:17:56): It feels like things are getting better, but it also feels.
Andrew (03:17:57-03:17:59): Just revealed more things.
Andrew (03:18:00-03:18:01): Well.
Bryan (03:18:03-03:18:13): The tide I feel like I'm going to constantly fight against is I don't need it to be as defined and as complicated as a professional business in this world.
Andrew (03:18:13-03:18:14): I know that.
Andrew (03:18:15-03:18:28): And the thing is, where we differ is you think that I don't know that from what I'm saying to you, but I'm also saying it from an outside point of view of like, you have a lot of inbuilt function and knowledge that everyone else doesn't.
Andrew (03:18:28-03:18:34): And I'm telling you that from an outsider's point of view that, yeah, like, and that's okay.
Andrew (03:18:34-03:18:35): Yeah.
Andrew (03:18:35-03:18:38): And it's okay that we disagree and agree on things too.
Bryan (03:18:38-03:18:39): It's okay if I leave and this all ends.
Andrew (03:18:42-03:18:47): But at the same time, we also have all these guys.
Bryan (03:18:48-03:18:50): Yeah, but I mean, that's where Jehovah comes in.
Andrew (03:18:50-03:18:54): No, I know, but like, doesn't mean that we don't put our best foot forward to do the right thing.
Andrew (03:18:55-03:18:56): Agreed.
Andrew (03:18:56-03:18:56): Yeah.
Bryan (03:18:56-03:19:02): And my best foot forward is now getting hamstrung long term if I make it too complicated.
Andrew (03:19:03-03:19:03): Right.
Andrew (03:19:04-03:19:07): But also trust, like, I'm not trying to make it complicated.
Andrew (03:19:07-03:19:13): I'm really trying to get the bare minimum without making sure I haven't set a specific path that isn't going anywhere.
Andrew (03:19:14-03:19:16): Like, it's a.
Andrew (03:19:16-03:19:17): It's a.
Andrew (03:19:17-03:19:24): Like, if we talk about it realistically, the first thing is you didn't even have the organization mindset when I got here.
Andrew (03:19:27-03:19:33): Like, it, like it was something like, if we look at trot is like four versions before you right now.
Andrew (03:19:33-03:19:41): Yeah, but like, that's what I'm saying to you like now that you understand that there's all these things that need to be organized, you wouldn't.
