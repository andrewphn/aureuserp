**Bryan** (02:26:10): A drop down for job and an.

**Andrew** (02:26:11): Item, that's how I can like let me show you tasks right now because you need to see what it looks like so you get what I'm talking about.

**Andrew** (02:26:24): Yeah.

**Andrew** (02:26:25): So coming up, the task.

**Andrew** (02:26:29): You cold?

**Bryan** (02:26:30): I'm freezing.

**Andrew** (02:26:33): When I hit a new task.

**Andrew** (02:26:36): I have a whole tag system.

**Bryan** (02:26:39): Oh, I broke my tag system.

**Andrew** (02:26:40): I'll fix that later.
