**Andrew** (02:15:03): And then here's the spec sheet of materials, and here's where all your materials are.

**Andrew** (02:15:08): What Else does Levi need?

**Bryan** (02:15:09): Well, Levi doesn't need to know where materials are because he needs to know where cut pieces are from the cnc.

**Andrew** (02:15:14): Right.

**Andrew** (02:15:14): So material like to make.

**Andrew** (02:15:16): It doesn't matter if it's cut or how to cut.

**Andrew** (02:15:18): He just needs to know where my stuff is.

**Andrew** (02:15:22): What else does he need?

**Bryan** (02:15:24): That's it.

**Andrew** (02:15:26): Okay, so what did Levi do when he's done?

**Bryan** (02:15:30): Drops it off to get to finishing.

**Andrew** (02:15:34): But how do we know he did that?
