**Andrew** (02:53:12): I do need to know what is a pass fail for a dwg.

**Andrew** (02:53:16): I need to know what a pass fail is for an adequate.

**Andrew** (02:53:19): For the scene.

**Andrew** (02:53:20): I need to know that there's correct tools.

**Andrew** (02:53:23): There's tools in here.

**Andrew** (02:53:24): I need.

**Andrew** (02:53:25): Like all that stuff needs to be said.

**Bryan** (02:53:28): It doesn't have to.

**Andrew** (02:53:29): No, it.

**Andrew** (02:53:30): It doesn't.

**Andrew** (02:53:31): It does have to.

**Andrew** (02:53:32): It doesn't have to if you know it.

**Andrew** (02:53:34): It does have to.

**Andrew** (02:53:35): If Shane quits tomorrow.

**Andrew** (02:53:38): What's true if Shane quits tomorrow, we're not.

**Andrew** (02:53:40): Well, that's not what I mean.

**Andrew** (02:53:42): But like, if you quit tomorrow, and that's the thing.

**Bryan** (02:53:45): Like, if at this position, if it stays the same, that's okay, but it doesn't.

**Andrew** (02:53:54): Because trot might flop, which we already talked about, you know, and I haven't.

**Bryan** (02:53:59): Worked with him, like, for many years.

**Bryan** (02:54:00): And were okay.

**Andrew** (02:54:03): Yeah, but like, we can keep it small business.

**Andrew** (02:54:05): I get what you're saying either way, because you're.

**Bryan** (02:54:08): You're coming back and saying, I'm one person.

**Bryan** (02:54:10): This is too much work.

**Bryan** (02:54:11): And I'm trying to, like, dial all that.

**Andrew** (02:54:13): No, I'm just saying we need to document and we need to write down, like, you know, how businesses like KFC, McDonald's survive and have thrived.

**Andrew** (02:54:21): I'm not talking about us getting into that scale, but when I worked at kfc, how I opened the lid to the fryer was defined.

**Andrew** (02:54:29): It was defined, like, I had to wait this period, amount of time I had this many turns, the weight that I was allowed to carry, how to stack this how to do that?

**Bryan** (02:54:38): It's not necessary.

**Andrew** (02:54:40): No, it is necessary, but not in one bite.

**Andrew** (02:54:46): Just do it as we're going.
