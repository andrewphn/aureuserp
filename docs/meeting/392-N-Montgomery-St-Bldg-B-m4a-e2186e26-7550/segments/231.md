## Transcript

**Andrew** (02:21:53): I mean, let's say that you need help with something on your cabinet.

**Andrew** (02:21:57): Right.

**Andrew** (02:21:57): It's not like there's something that you can pass someone else who can do easily or repetitively over and over.

**Andrew** (02:22:03): How are you currently asking for help?

**Bryan** (02:22:09): Gosh.

**Andrew** (02:22:10): I mean it's just depending on how much I have for the work for the day and like what I plan on taking on.

**Andrew** (02:22:16): I'll farm out things that I'm working on.

**Andrew** (02:22:19): But so that what I'm asking is that farming out is done in a task and not just hey, are you doing anything?

**Andrew** (02:22:28): Can you go cut that for me?
