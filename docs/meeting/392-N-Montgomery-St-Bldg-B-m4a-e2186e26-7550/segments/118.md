**Bryan** (01:12:22): Door profile.

**Andrew** (01:12:24): Okay.

**Andrew** (01:12:25): If there is a door or not.

**Bryan** (01:12:27): Yeah, yeah.

**Andrew** (01:12:28): So you have to.

**Andrew** (01:12:29): You have to work down for me.

**Andrew** (01:12:31): So look out the cabinet.

**Bryan** (01:12:32): Yep.

**Andrew** (01:12:33): What globally exists for every cabinet finish material.

**Andrew** (01:12:40): What else?

**Andrew** (01:12:47): I don't know.

**Andrew** (01:12:48): Just finished material really.

**Andrew** (01:12:50): Right.

**Andrew** (01:12:53): And so the cabinet run will determine its type.

**Andrew** (01:12:55): So four, let's go base cabinets now.

**Andrew** (01:12:57): Four base cabinets.

**Andrew** (01:12:59): What are the elements of a base cabinet?

**Bryan** (01:13:04): Like what types could you have?

**Andrew** (01:13:06): No.

**Andrew** (01:13:06): So we'll deal with subs in a second.

**Andrew** (01:13:09): So in terms of the construction of.

**Bryan** (01:13:10): A box, just the face frame or European.

**Andrew** (01:13:13): Okay, so face frame.

**Andrew** (01:13:14): Tell me about that.

**Bryan** (01:13:15): A face frame cabinet.

**Andrew** (01:13:16): Yeah.

**Andrew** (01:13:16): Or European.

**Andrew** (01:13:18): Okay, cool.

**Andrew** (01:13:19): What else?

**Andrew** (01:13:22): Think globally.

**Bryan** (01:13:23): Just pure box, drawers, doors open.

**Andrew** (01:13:27): We're gonna go there now.

**Andrew** (01:13:28): So then.

**Andrew** (01:13:28): Okay, so that's it.

**Andrew** (01:13:29): Just what type of face frame?

**Andrew** (01:13:33): Does it have a kick?

**Andrew** (01:13:34): Does it not?

**Andrew** (01:13:35): Yes.

**Andrew** (01:13:35): No, For a kick.

**Andrew** (01:13:36): So this is base.

**Andrew** (01:13:37): We're talking base.

**Andrew** (01:13:39): What do we do about countertop?

**Andrew** (01:13:40): Does it need a top?

**Andrew** (01:13:42): Sure.

**Andrew** (01:13:43): Like, because Sometimes you build a cabinet without a top, right?

**Andrew** (01:13:45): Yeah.

**Bryan** (01:13:46): Like if it's stone.

**Andrew** (01:13:48): Okay.

**Andrew** (01:13:48): It doesn't need a tongue.

**Andrew** (01:13:49): What else?

**Andrew** (01:13:55): And then a notes.

**Andrew** (01:13:56): Right, that's general notes.

**Andrew** (01:13:58): What else?

**Andrew** (01:13:59): Before you go into detail about sub components inside.

**Bryan** (01:14:05): I think those are pretty cool.

**Andrew** (01:14:06): Okay, so then the next part is what sub components exist?

**Bryan** (01:14:13): Doors, drawers, shelving, pull outs.

**Andrew** (01:14:17): Yeah, pull outs.

**Andrew** (01:14:18): What else?

**Bryan** (01:14:19): End panels.

**Andrew** (01:14:21): End panels.

**Andrew** (01:14:22): Okay, cool.

**Andrew** (01:14:22): Does this have an end panel?

**Andrew** (01:14:23): So that's actually in the global level.

**Andrew** (01:14:25): Is this an end panel one?

**Bryan** (01:14:27): Okay.

**Andrew** (01:14:28): You know what I mean?

**Andrew** (01:14:28): Yeah.

**Andrew** (01:14:29): Because not all of them have end panels.

**Andrew** (01:14:30): No.

**Andrew** (01:14:31): Yeah.

**Bryan** (01:14:31): And then is it a decorative end panel or is it a flat end panel?

**Andrew** (01:14:35): Cool.

**Andrew** (01:14:36): Look at the picture.

**Andrew** (01:14:37): What else is that?

**Bryan** (01:14:38): Appliance returns.

**Bryan** (01:14:40): Farmhouse sinks.

**Andrew** (01:14:43): No, don't do farmhouse yet.

**Andrew** (01:14:45): So, like.

**Andrew** (01:14:45): Oh, no, it is.

**Andrew** (01:14:47): There's a type of base cabinet.

**Andrew** (01:14:49): There's end, there's sink, and there's appliance.

**Andrew** (01:14:54): Okay, right.

**Andrew** (01:14:56): So like, is it on an end?

**Andrew** (01:14:59): Is it a sink cabinet?

**Andrew** (01:15:01): Is it an appliance cabinet?

**Bryan** (01:15:04): Is it a middle cabinet?

**Andrew** (01:15:06): No, because middle is going to be the generic.

**Bryan** (01:15:08): Okay.

**Andrew** (01:15:09): Yeah.

**Bryan** (01:15:10): Inside corner, blind corner.

**Andrew** (01:15:12): Inside corner, blind corner.

**Andrew** (01:15:13): Okay, cool.

**Andrew** (01:15:14): So that's great.

**Andrew** (01:15:15): So let's go.

**Andrew** (01:15:17): Let's go with just generic.

**Andrew** (01:15:20): Let's talk about what are the sub component types.

**Andrew** (01:15:22): They are shelf, drawer, door, pull out.

**Andrew** (01:15:28): Pull out?

**Bryan** (01:15:29): Yeah, like you open a door and you have a pull out.

**Andrew** (01:15:31): Okay, cool.

**Andrew** (01:15:32): What other types of things can be a sub cabinet thing, open shelving.

**Andrew** (01:15:39): That's already.

**Andrew** (01:15:40): Yeah, that's it.

**Andrew** (01:15:42): Okay, cool.

**Andrew** (01:15:43): Now on those sub components, let's walk one by one on doors.

**Andrew** (01:15:48): What are all the features of a.

**Bryan** (01:15:50): Door that needs to be profile, type, finish, fabrication?

**Andrew** (01:15:54): Is the finish ever different from the cabinet for doors?

**Andrew** (01:15:58): Yeah.

**Bryan** (01:15:59): Yeah.

**Bryan** (01:15:59): We did one that was like all painted cabinets and the walnut cabinets.

**Andrew** (01:16:04): So would it adopt the finish from the cabinet if nothing is defined?

**Andrew** (01:16:08): Yeah.

**Andrew** (01:16:08): Okay, cool.

**Andrew** (01:16:10): Tops.

**Andrew** (01:16:11): Is that all for doors?

**Bryan** (01:16:14): Is that where you would say blind hinge or regular hinge?

**Andrew** (01:16:18): Yes.

**Andrew** (01:16:18): If it's related to the door, then yes.

**Bryan** (01:16:20): Yeah.

**Bryan** (01:16:20): So hinge type.

**Andrew** (01:16:21): Hinge type.

**Andrew** (01:16:22): Yeah.

**Andrew** (01:16:23): Cool.

**Andrew** (01:16:24): Anything else on doors you did profile?

**Bryan** (01:16:27): I would do fabrication because we don't cut all doors in the cnc.

**Bryan** (01:16:32): So they need to know, am I making this five piece or am I making this?
