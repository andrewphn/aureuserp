Discussion about cabinet

## Transcript

**Andrew** (01:04:55): So that's why I didn't just go, you are assigned this cabinet.

**Andrew** (01:04:59): You're doing this.

**Andrew** (01:05:00): You're doing this.

**Andrew** (01:05:00): It gives you the option without that grouping, we can't do it.

**Andrew** (01:05:03): Now, looking at that, at the cabinet run level, what details can you give or you want to enter?

**Andrew** (01:05:11): Let's say you're entering this in the way that I just told you.

**Andrew** (01:05:14): Okay.

**Andrew** (01:05:14): So you've determined this is the room location.

**Andrew** (01:05:16): This is K1.

**Andrew** (01:05:17): It's kitchen, sink, wall.

**Bryan** (01:05:20): Okay.

**Andrew** (01:05:20): Right.

**Andrew** (01:05:21): So the next spec is.

**Andrew** (01:05:22): I see two sets of things.

**Bryan** (01:05:26): You mean like uppers and lowers?

**Andrew** (01:05:27): Uppers and lowers.

**Andrew** (01:05:28): Okay, so.

**Bryan** (01:05:29): And even though this is just shells, you could call it uppers.

**Andrew** (01:05:32): Yeah, it's an upper.

**Andrew** (01:05:33): Yeah.

**Andrew** (01:05:33): So this is upper one.

**Bryan** (01:05:35): Okay.

**Andrew** (01:05:36): Yeah.

**Andrew** (01:05:36): Because they are built separately.

**Andrew** (01:05:37): Right.

**Andrew** (01:05:38): So inside, upper cabinet run is upper one and upper two.

**Andrew** (01:05:42): And then down here we have base.

**Bryan** (01:05:45): You have one run of lowers.

**Andrew** (01:05:47): Yeah.

**Bryan** (01:05:48): Two base cabinets and an appliance.

**Andrew** (01:05:50): Okay, so where's the two base cabinets?

**Andrew** (01:05:52): One.

**Andrew** (01:05:53): Yep.

**Bryan** (01:05:54): Two.

**Andrew** (01:05:54): Okay.

**Andrew** (01:05:55): And then how do you want to do defining cabinets?

**Andrew** (01:06:02): So in my annotation, you've seen the way that I've got it.

**Andrew** (01:06:04): Basically what I'm gonna have you do is you get to draw K1.

**Andrew** (01:06:09): Like this is K1.

**Andrew** (01:06:11): And then I've got it disabled right now.

**Andrew** (01:06:13): But when you double click on it just isolates that box and you can draw another box inside.

**Bryan** (01:06:18): And you're only doing it from plan view.

**Andrew** (01:06:20): No, you can do this from any.

**Bryan** (01:06:22): View page three and it can be on different pages.

**Bryan** (01:06:25): K1.

**Andrew** (01:06:26): Correct.

**Andrew** (01:06:26): Look.

**Andrew** (01:06:27): So I built you a tree that has.

**Andrew** (01:06:30): That unifies everything together.

**Andrew** (01:06:32): So you can draw the plan view, the front view, and then later on, when you finish doing this part, you can pull a page report for that cabinet and it gives you the plan, it gives you the elevation for it, and it gives you all the specs that you did.

**Andrew** (01:06:44): You can pull a cabinet run report, and it gives you the entire cabinet run report.

**Andrew** (01:06:49): But the idea of why this is taking so long is to make sure that I built this universal structure and that I can have it do whatever you need it to do.

**Bryan** (01:06:56): But what it can't do is what it doesn't have.

**Bryan** (01:06:59): It can't pull the face frame dimensions.

**Andrew** (01:07:02): It can if you write them in.

**Bryan** (01:07:04): I can't write them in this PDF in a clean way.
