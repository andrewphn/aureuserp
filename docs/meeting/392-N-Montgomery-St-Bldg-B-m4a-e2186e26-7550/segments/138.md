## Transcript

**Andrew** (01:29:38): So I'll look at the drawing that you sent me, and it's got this, and there's like a drawer opening at the top, and there's a door, a thing called a door.

**Andrew** (01:29:46): Okay, now what do I know?

**Andrew** (01:29:51): Need to know before I go and.

**Bryan** (01:29:52): Cut that face frame, what it's interacting with on the other side.

**Andrew** (01:29:56): Yeah.

**Andrew** (01:29:57): So I need to know.

**Andrew** (01:29:57): Okay, does I see a door?

**Andrew** (01:29:59): What kind of door is it?

**Andrew** (01:30:00): So you.

**Andrew** (01:30:00): No, no.

**Bryan** (01:30:01): You're saying the face frame.

**Andrew** (01:30:02): Yeah.

**Bryan** (01:30:03): So you need to know what the next cabinet Is.

**Bryan** (01:30:05): Or what it's going next to or.

**Andrew** (01:30:07): Oh, okay.

**Andrew** (01:30:08): Yeah.

**Andrew** (01:30:08): Because the face frame goes.

**Bryan** (01:30:09): So.

**Andrew** (01:30:10): So is a face frame connected to a cabinet run or a cabinet run?

**Andrew** (01:30:14): Okay, so face frames are on the cabinet run level.

**Andrew** (01:30:17): Cool.

**Andrew** (01:30:18): So that's something we need to know.

**Andrew** (01:30:19): So the cabinet is just a shell behind the face cabinet run.

**Bryan** (01:30:25): No, I'm sorry.

**Bryan** (01:30:26): It's on the cabinet level.

**Andrew** (01:30:27): Oh, it is on the cabinet level.

**Andrew** (01:30:29): So how do you separate this?

**Andrew** (01:30:32): Let's say there's a door and a drawer.

**Andrew** (01:30:35): And then this.

**Andrew** (01:30:35): There's the another one next to it.

**Andrew** (01:30:38): That is open shelves.

**Andrew** (01:30:40): Are you considering that's one cabinet?

**Andrew** (01:30:43): So then how do I call those sections?

**Andrew** (01:30:45): Oh, they call sections.

**Andrew** (01:30:47): So how many sections does a cabinet have?

**Andrew** (01:30:49): Is a question I would have.

**Andrew** (01:30:51): And then we determine each of those sections.

**Andrew** (01:30:54): The specs for it probably just open.

**Andrew** (01:31:01): No more to it.

**Andrew** (01:31:02): I've got it.

**Andrew** (01:31:03): I think you should call.

**Bryan** (01:31:04): I think that's a.

**Bryan** (01:31:05): Like a real cotton.

**Bryan** (01:31:06): The weed spot.

**Andrew** (01:31:07): No, that's.

**Andrew** (01:31:07): I need to work out how to put door like.

**Andrew** (01:31:11): This section here has this size opening has shelves in it.

**Andrew** (01:31:16): This section here has a drawer.

**Andrew** (01:31:18): And this section here has a cabinet with a door.

**Andrew** (01:31:21): There's sections.

**Andrew** (01:31:22): They're cabinet sections.

**Andrew** (01:31:25): So I'm just determining what's on going the category below a cabinet.

**Andrew** (01:31:29): Now, the reason I'm asking that I think.

**Bryan** (01:31:31): I think you would have cabinet.

**Andrew** (01:31:32): Yeah.

**Bryan** (01:31:33): And then you would have openings.

**Bryan** (01:31:35): And then just opening definition.

**Bryan** (01:31:38): Is it a drawer?

**Andrew** (01:31:41): Is it open?

**Bryan** (01:31:42): Shelving?

**Andrew** (01:31:43): And then let's say I have to make the face frame for this on the cabinet level.

**Andrew** (01:31:48): I'm trying to make sure that you have given those details so that face frame can be made without having to ask you.

**Andrew** (01:31:55): So what am I missing that you.

**Bryan** (01:31:57): Haven'T given me a lot of work like that.

**Bryan** (01:32:00): That is the point where you have to go into Rhino and get all your face frame dimensions.

**Andrew** (01:32:04): So what are those?

**Andrew** (01:32:05): Tell me those things.

**Bryan** (01:32:07): Your overall height.

**Bryan** (01:32:08): Yeah, your face frame height.

**Bryan** (01:32:10): What's happening on either side of the cabinet.

**Andrew** (01:32:12): Okay.

**Andrew** (01:32:13): And what's happening on either side of the cabinet?

**Bryan** (01:32:15): Tell me about that wall scribe appliance return.

**Bryan** (01:32:18): Inside corner.

**Andrew** (01:32:18): Okay, cool.

**Andrew** (01:32:19): Yep.

**Andrew** (01:32:20): What else is that?

**Bryan** (01:32:23): Your openings.

**Andrew** (01:32:23): Yep.

**Bryan** (01:32:24): All your defined openings.

**Bryan** (01:32:25): Height and width.

**Andrew** (01:32:27): Thickness.

**Andrew** (01:32:28): Is the opening different to where the face frame comes down to?

**Andrew** (01:32:32): Because that happens a lot.

**Andrew** (01:32:33): So the actual whole opening on the face frame is different to the actual inside every time.

**Andrew** (01:32:40): It is.

**Andrew** (01:32:41): So like, how do I know what size my face frame?

**Andrew** (01:32:45): The actual hole?

**Bryan** (01:32:47): So that's what we're defining.

**Andrew** (01:32:48): Okay.

**Bryan** (01:32:49): But like A length and width.

**Andrew** (01:32:51): Yeah, but, like, how do.

**Andrew** (01:32:53): So what's the field name for that?

**Andrew** (01:32:56): Let's say my job is.

**Andrew** (01:32:57): I'm tasked with just cutting the face frame.

**Andrew** (01:33:00): What do I need?

**Andrew** (01:33:01): Like, how do I know where and how to cut it?

**Bryan** (01:33:04): I think we're circling the drain.

**Andrew** (01:33:05): Yeah, we're talking about the same thing.

**Bryan** (01:33:10): This is what you need.

**Andrew** (01:33:13): I just need you to say out loud what the actual dimension is.

**Andrew** (01:33:16): I am like, the type of dimension, not the actual number, but like, hey.

**Bryan** (01:33:21): It'S a length and a width.

**Bryan** (01:33:23): It's a height and a width.

**Andrew** (01:33:28): Just show me that we're talking about the same thing.

**Andrew** (01:33:31): I think just a little.

**Bryan** (01:33:37): This is an example where it's.

**Bryan** (01:33:38): It's not that simple.

**Bryan** (01:33:40): Because being in a trade for a long time, you already know how to build a face frame.

**Bryan** (01:33:44): It's not.

**Andrew** (01:33:45): I get you, I get you.

**Andrew** (01:33:47): But, like, I'm trying to get you to have.

**Andrew** (01:33:49): As before, you talk to a person.

**Bryan** (01:33:51): Bath.

**Bryan** (01:33:53): You have your height.

**Andrew** (01:33:55): Yeah, that's the whole cabinet.

**Bryan** (01:33:57): You have your opening overall.

**Andrew** (01:33:59): Yeah.

**Bryan** (01:33:59): You have individual openings.

**Bryan** (01:34:01): You have opening width.

**Andrew** (01:34:05): Okay.

**Andrew** (01:34:06): And.

**Andrew** (01:34:07): Okay, let me give you this.

**Andrew** (01:34:09): So this is the overall height, not of the face frame or of the cabinet.

**Bryan** (01:34:12): In this case.

**Bryan** (01:34:13): No face frame.

**Andrew** (01:34:14): So this is the face frame.

**Andrew** (01:34:15): This is the overall cap cabinet with countertop, with count.

**Andrew** (01:34:19): This one here, like, 42.

**Andrew** (01:34:22): Yeah.

**Andrew** (01:34:22): Right.

**Andrew** (01:34:23): So I need to make the face frame.

**Andrew** (01:34:26): I need to know that I'm cutting 41 by 57, 9, 16.

**Andrew** (01:34:30): That's my first thing that I'm technically making.

**Andrew** (01:34:33): If it's one solid piece, it's never.

**Andrew** (01:34:36): I'm just.

**Andrew** (01:34:37): I'm just hypothetically right now, just so it's easy to understand, because, like.

**Andrew** (01:34:41): And then I need to know individual openings.

**Andrew** (01:34:45): So that's a measurement.

**Andrew** (01:34:46): I'm.

**Andrew** (01:34:46): So there's height and width.

**Andrew** (01:34:47): How many openings are there?

**Andrew** (01:34:49): And then height and width.

**Andrew** (01:34:51): What else am I missing?

**Bryan** (01:34:53): Scribe.

**Bryan** (01:34:54): Scribe.

**Bryan** (01:34:54): Okay, return.

**Andrew** (01:34:56): So tell me what that those actual names would be.

**Andrew** (01:34:59): Scribe.

**Andrew** (01:34:59): Width, Scribe.

**Andrew** (01:35:00): Height, Scribe.

**Andrew** (01:35:01): Position, Scribe.

**Andrew** (01:35:02): What?

**Andrew** (01:35:03): That's all I need.

**Andrew** (01:35:04): I don't need to know the data.

**Andrew** (01:35:05): I just need to know the fields that you would put a number in.

**Bryan** (01:35:07): So that it's just scribe, yes or no.

**Andrew** (01:35:10): Okay.

**Andrew** (01:35:11): And then things like, is there anything else?

**Andrew** (01:35:14): So what I've seen is overall height, overall width of face internal sections, how many there are, and then their length and width.

**Bryan** (01:35:25): This is not a number a face frame person needs.

**Andrew** (01:35:29): What is that number?

**Bryan** (01:35:30): It's the overall.

**Bryan** (01:35:31): He needs this inside because your face frame, he has to know how to hold.

**Andrew** (01:35:34): Cool.

**Andrew** (01:35:34): So that'll be in the capital section.

**Andrew** (01:35:37): But face frame will have what's the overall inside.

**Bryan** (01:35:40): Exactly.

**Andrew** (01:35:41): So which is.

**Andrew** (01:35:42): That's all I need to know from you.

**Andrew** (01:35:44): It's like overall face frame height and width is different from overall cabinet height and width, which is a number.

**Andrew** (01:35:50): I just need to give you the feel so you can type it in.

**Andrew** (01:35:54): I'm just asking you for the feel that you want.

**Bryan** (01:35:57): Okay.

**Bryan** (01:35:57): So I don't know if we need to go this route.
