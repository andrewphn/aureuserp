Discussion about cabinet

## Transcript

**Bryan** (02:23:28): He needs like a Google sheet or something that says the job that's associated with a drop down for the cabinet that it's associated with and a descriptive just to enter.

**Andrew** (02:23:39): I might have to run more because.

**Bryan** (02:23:41): This is having a bit of a mental breakdown.

**Bryan** (02:23:43): Yeah, no worries.

**Bryan** (02:23:45): Sorry, man.

**Andrew** (02:23:49): We got it.

**Andrew** (02:23:53): I'll tell you what I mean.

**Andrew** (02:23:54): If I am about to take on a cabinet and I'm Levi, this is how I would ideally want it and you can tell me if this is doable or not, is that before he takes the job on, he already has broken down in his mind what he can part out and what complicated things he needs to work on.

**Andrew** (02:24:13): Because you can assign tasks at everything.

**Andrew** (02:24:16): You can assign tasks to a door, you can assign tasks to an opening, you can assign tasks to a whole cabinet and you can assign it to any person.

**Andrew** (02:24:25): So like when he's doing the planning phase, like he's just been given the job, he's going, okay, I can do all that.

**Andrew** (02:24:34): I probably should get so and so started on sanding this stuff down.

**Andrew** (02:24:39): Sanding assigned to cabinet.

**Andrew** (02:24:42): Then that person, let's say that he's starting his job on a Monday and they come in on a Wednesday.

**Andrew** (02:24:47): He's like, I don't have to worry about that for now.

**Andrew** (02:24:50): Someone else can do that down the road.

**Andrew** (02:24:51): He can make the task so that it's ready for that person when they come in Wednesday.

**Andrew** (02:24:56): That's what I'm talking about.

**Andrew** (02:24:58): But you need dedicated time and they do it on the floor because I've seen them out there with the paper plans, just leaning over their bench reading the plan before they start.

**Andrew** (02:25:06): That's a thing.

**Andrew** (02:25:07): But I just need that documented and not just in their minds.

**Andrew** (02:25:13): So you tell me how I can get that.

**Bryan** (02:25:15): Yeah, because that's going to be too much.

**Bryan** (02:25:16): It's going to be.

**Bryan** (02:25:18): The idea is good, the execution should be simpler.

**Andrew** (02:25:22): Yeah, don't worry about how long it's going to take.

**Andrew** (02:25:25): That's my job.

**Andrew** (02:25:26): But that's what the concept is, what I'm saying.

**Bryan** (02:25:28): The execution for them cannot be long.

**Andrew** (02:25:31): It needs to be simple.

**Andrew** (02:25:32): It needs to be a simple, simple thing.

**Andrew** (02:25:34): If it's complicated, they won't do it.

**Andrew** (02:25:37): Can they write it on a piece of paper and then get a person to fill it in?

**Bryan** (02:25:44): Why aren't people creating a job?

**Bryan** (02:25:46): What I think would better would be to look at what is our end product out the door, which is.

**Andrew** (02:25:52): Our bill of laden.

**Bryan** (02:25:55): Because it's not a kitchen for Andrew.

**Bryan** (02:25:57): It's on the individual cabinets, individual doors.

**Andrew** (02:26:00): Like all like that bill of lading is already made here.
