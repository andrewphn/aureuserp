## Transcript

**Andrew** (01:18:29): Doors covered.

**Andrew** (01:18:31): Is there anything else about doors you.

**Bryan** (01:18:35): Could do decorative hardware?

**Bryan** (01:18:36): Like yes or no?

**Bryan** (01:18:37): If we supply them.

**Bryan** (01:18:38): Because if it's used.

**Andrew** (01:18:39): Oh, yeah.

**Andrew** (01:18:40): Do you want to have hardware as an overall hardware or do you want to determine it at the component level?

**Andrew** (01:18:52): I don't know.

**Andrew** (01:18:53): Where would you do it?

**Bryan** (01:18:57): Decorative hardware?

**Andrew** (01:18:58): No, just hardware in general.

**Andrew** (01:19:00): Do you want.

**Andrew** (01:19:01): Do you want hardware, that whole section, or do you want hardware as like related to its cabinet?

**Bryan** (01:19:10): I guess related to the cabinets.

**Andrew** (01:19:11): 40 volt.

**Andrew** (01:19:12): I bought like many.

**Bryan** (01:19:12): You got any 40 volt batteries?

**Andrew** (01:19:15): Is that a 40 volter?

**Andrew** (01:19:16): Yeah, gold.

**Andrew** (01:19:18): I know.

**Bryan** (01:19:18): I bought it to.

**Bryan** (01:19:19): For Levi so he'd stop using DeWalt.

**Bryan** (01:19:22): Like a DeWalt.

**Andrew** (01:19:25): But I don't have to get 40 balls.

**Andrew** (01:19:28): No, don't have any.

**Andrew** (01:19:29): This should work.

**Andrew** (01:19:30): Yeah.

**Andrew** (01:19:36): Are you going?

**Andrew** (01:19:36): I mean, what I mean to ask is like when do you want to say that?

**Bryan** (01:19:40): I think my brain's having a hard time understanding.

**Bryan** (01:19:42): What I want at the end is a BOM that has all this specific hardware at this point right now, if I'm choosing the hardware type, it doesn't have to be as simple as inset.

**Bryan** (01:19:52): It could be the blown insert a hardware.

**Andrew** (01:19:55): I got that.

**Andrew** (01:19:56): So what, Once we finish doing this, you should get all of the hardware options and then you pick one.

**Andrew** (01:20:02): So for example, we've got four insets.

**Andrew** (01:20:05): Then you should select like, it'll say, here are all the hardware.

**Andrew** (01:20:09): It's a hardware list.

**Andrew** (01:20:10): And then you go.
