## Transcript

**Andrew** (34:13): We don't have a master inventory management yet.

**Bryan** (34:17): Current inventory.

**Andrew** (34:22): The thing is, we started a manual way of doing it.

**Andrew** (34:24): It's getting your staff to do it.

**Andrew** (34:31): Everyone's getting pulled to side jobs all the time.

**Bryan** (34:34): So it's not a problem that's going away.

**Andrew** (34:37): True, but we have to.

**Andrew** (34:39): If we don't, I can't solve it.

**Andrew** (34:41): If we don't have the resources.

**Bryan** (34:43): So this is.

**Bryan** (34:43): This.

**Bryan** (34:48): Two to four hours a week.

**Andrew** (34:49): Sadie's not coming in and counting stock.

**Andrew** (34:51): She can.

**Andrew** (34:53): Okay.

**Andrew** (34:53): She wants it.

**Bryan** (34:54): She doesn't want to.

**Bryan** (34:55): She wants to do secretarial stuff.

**Andrew** (34:56): Okay.

**Bryan** (34:57): But we have.

**Bryan** (34:59): I need.

**Bryan** (34:59): She wants to, like, come in and interview for a job next week.

**Bryan** (35:03): Like, really try to be professional and figure out something.

**Andrew** (35:06): So Sadie's job is.

**Andrew** (35:07): She's gonna do it.

**Andrew** (35:08): She's.

**Andrew** (35:09): She is perfect.

**Andrew** (35:10): You know why?

**Andrew** (35:11): She can look at money.

**Bryan** (35:13): Yeah, definitely.

**Andrew** (35:14): We don't.

**Andrew** (35:14): Like, as in we don't care that Sadie knows how much a job is.

**Andrew** (35:17): It doesn't matter to us.

**Bryan** (35:18): Right.

**Andrew** (35:19): So Sadie's that person.

**Andrew** (35:21): That means Sadie's the inventory person.
