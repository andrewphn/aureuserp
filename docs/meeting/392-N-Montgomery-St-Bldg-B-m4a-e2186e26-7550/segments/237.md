**Andrew** (02:26:58): I actually have the design changed to be column so you don't have to.

**Bryan** (02:27:01): Go through all the levels.

**Andrew** (02:27:02): But the idea is that this task can be made for any phase, for any section.

**Andrew** (02:27:09): And the task can also have tags attached to it like urgent, not urgent.

**Andrew** (02:27:16): All the types of things that you could possibly think of are there.

**Andrew** (02:27:20): And then the idea.

**Andrew** (02:27:21): It could also be attached to a milestone.

**Andrew** (02:27:23): So when this task has been completed, I can allow it to move to the next phase.

**Andrew** (02:27:28): It has assignees, it has deadlines, it has allocated hours.

**Andrew** (02:27:33): You don't have to fill anything in.

**Andrew** (02:27:35): You can just fill in the title if you wanted to, general tasks.

**Andrew** (02:27:39): But it's automatically associated to a project already.

**Andrew** (02:27:42): But I'm saying that if I'm working on something, I Will probably make a way to bulk make tasks with all the same data.
