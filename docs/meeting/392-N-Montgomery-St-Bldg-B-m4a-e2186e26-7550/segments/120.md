**Bryan** (01:17:25): Drawers.

**Andrew** (01:17:27): Yep.

**Andrew** (01:17:28): So tell me.

**Andrew** (01:17:28): So imagine this though.

**Andrew** (01:17:30): You have to understand what I'm asking you to do here.

**Andrew** (01:17:33): When you draw a door, you have to go to the door tab and fill in all the door stuff.

**Bryan** (01:17:42): That's why it's going to better to practice together.

**Andrew** (01:17:45): I'm just saying.

**Andrew** (01:17:46): But like, is that something.

**Andrew** (01:17:47): Yeah, I'm gonna.

**Andrew** (01:17:48): Yeah.

**Bryan** (01:17:49): And I have a serious aversion.

**Bryan** (01:17:51): But I will 100% try because I see what the end goal is.

**Andrew** (01:17:55): Yeah.

**Andrew** (01:17:55): And the thing is, I don't want you to do this.

**Andrew** (01:17:58): I want somebody else to do it.

**Andrew** (01:17:59): It's not about you.

**Andrew** (01:18:01): It's about the person who is going to fulfill that role.

**Andrew** (01:18:04): You hate doing it because you're doing 5,000 other things.

**Andrew** (01:18:08): But if your job is to spec out a job, you're filling in the details that are going to come up.

**Andrew** (01:18:14): Because guess what?

**Andrew** (01:18:15): Those guys are going to ask.

**Andrew** (01:18:16): What is it?

**Andrew** (01:18:17): Is it an inset hinge?

**Andrew** (01:18:18): Is it a boulevard?

**Andrew** (01:18:19): It should already be there for them.
