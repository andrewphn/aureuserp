## Transcript

**Andrew** (02:45:51): Yeah, I can probably when I get back tonight finish building out the specs that we just recorded for cabinets, doors, all that kind of stuff.

**Andrew** (02:46:01): And I was give you the link.

**Bryan** (02:46:03): So I still have to band aid.

**Andrew** (02:46:05): What's the band aid?

**Bryan** (02:46:07): How do I make job grades?

**Andrew** (02:46:15): No, I think what I can do is once you've made it here in the system, you've made all the tasks and stuff, then I can make an export.

**Andrew** (02:46:25): Yeah, but that's.

**Andrew** (02:46:27): Let me, let me look at that.

**Andrew** (02:46:30): I don't think that's that crazy, but let me make sure that you can make tasks and stuff correctly first.
