Discussion about cabinet

## Transcript

**Andrew** (02:27:50): So let's say that we're working on a cabinet.

**Andrew** (02:27:52): You go into the cabinet, you create a task, you get to add multi line of tasks and then assign all the people and it goes out.

**Andrew** (02:28:00): But the idea is that you can say for the cabinet, doors need sanding.

**Andrew** (02:28:08): So I'm going to select the cabinet and then I'm going to say, doors need sanding.

**Andrew** (02:28:11): I'm assigned it to whatever.

**Andrew** (02:28:15): That's what I'm saying to you.

**Andrew** (02:28:17): And then everyone will just have a task list just show up.

**Andrew** (02:28:24): I've already built it.

**Andrew** (02:28:25): I'm just like getting it.

**Andrew** (02:28:27): I just haven't handed it to you.

**Bryan** (02:28:32): I think it falls the same category.

**Bryan** (02:28:33): Let's work it out, let's test it out.

**Bryan** (02:28:35): Because I think it's a great idea.

**Bryan** (02:28:36): Because then everybody has their own work.

**Andrew** (02:28:39): But how do I get it so that you can do it?

**Andrew** (02:28:42): And like, so McKenna, the day before she comes in, if her tasks are already assigned, she knows what she's done.

**Andrew** (02:28:49): She can look.

**Andrew** (02:28:50): Oh, man, I've got eight tasks I get done today.

**Andrew** (02:28:52): They've already assigned it to me.

**Andrew** (02:28:54): Can't have a sick day to date.

**Andrew** (02:28:55): There's like 20 things going on.

**Andrew** (02:28:57): Oh, it's gonna be a quick day for me.

**Andrew** (02:28:58): I've only got four tasks it's gonna take me to.

**Andrew** (02:29:00): Then in each task, just update where you're at.

**Andrew** (02:29:05): Connects to your timesheets.

**Andrew** (02:29:07): Yeah, I've already built so much of it.

**Andrew** (02:29:11): That's why I'm saying I need to know that this will get used.

**Andrew** (02:29:16): And how do I.

**Andrew** (02:29:17): What do I need to change about it to make it get used?

**Bryan** (02:29:20): And we won't know that until we start using it.

**Andrew** (02:29:23): Okay.

**Andrew** (02:29:25): I know, for example, that task creation thing and task checking thing has to be for phone compatible.

**Bryan** (02:29:32): Has to.

**Andrew** (02:29:32): Yeah.
