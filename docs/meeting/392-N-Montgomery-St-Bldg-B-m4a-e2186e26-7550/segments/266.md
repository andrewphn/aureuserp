**Andrew** (02:42:04): But her main thing is she's in purchasing.

**Andrew** (02:42:06): If she's doing two to four hours.

**Bryan** (02:42:08): A week and she can do something, well, she won't need to do payroll.

**Andrew** (02:42:12): Purchasing and payroll.

**Andrew** (02:42:13): Yeah.

**Andrew** (02:42:17): Which means we need to start to build out our vendor lists.

**Bryan** (02:42:20): She could do accounting too, eventually.

**Andrew** (02:42:22): Yeah.

**Andrew** (02:42:23): So she's basically doing the opposite thing.

**Andrew** (02:42:25): But we.

**Andrew** (02:42:26): What things we don't need or don't have?

**Andrew** (02:42:28): We don't have a vendor list right now.

**Andrew** (02:42:32): You have them on email.

**Andrew** (02:42:33): You know who they are.

**Andrew** (02:42:34): But we don't have an official company documentation.

**Andrew** (02:42:38): So that's a task she has to do right away.

**Andrew** (02:42:39): Build up vendor list.

**Andrew** (02:42:42): Then she has to know who the points of contact are.

**Andrew** (02:42:44): You have to talk to her about that.

**Andrew** (02:42:45): This is who we talk to.

**Andrew** (02:42:46): This is what you need to know about this place.

**Andrew** (02:42:49): She has to keep a ledger of that.

**Andrew** (02:42:52): And this is where we order our hardware.

**Andrew** (02:42:55): She has to, like, find the most efficient ways to do that.

**Andrew** (02:42:58): Not be doing these crazy Amazon orders that we're doing on time.

**Andrew** (02:43:01): So that's.

**Andrew** (02:43:01): That's already a job in itself.

**Andrew** (02:43:03): So she's going to do purchasing.

**Andrew** (02:43:04): Payroll, I think purchasing and payroll.

**Andrew** (02:43:09): And then.
