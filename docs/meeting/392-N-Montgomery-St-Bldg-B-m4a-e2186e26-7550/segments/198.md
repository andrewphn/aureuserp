**Bryan** (02:05:19): What really changes we did at the door level?

**Bryan** (02:05:21): If it's blind hardware.

**Andrew** (02:05:23): Okay.

**Andrew** (02:05:23): So that we've already said because the.

**Bryan** (02:05:25): Opening would already be defined.

**Bryan** (02:05:27): It's done.

**Andrew** (02:05:27): Okay.

**Andrew** (02:05:28): Now full tell me what we're hockey.

**Bryan** (02:05:31): Pretty much the same.

**Bryan** (02:05:32): It's a little bit of a combo.

**Bryan** (02:05:34): Is there brown?

**Bryan** (02:05:35): What type of pull outs you got in it?

**Andrew** (02:05:37): Yeah.

**Andrew** (02:05:37): Okay.

**Andrew** (02:05:38): He brought the whole palette.

**Andrew** (02:05:40): I think we did it wrong.

**Bryan** (02:05:44): Oh, it looks super backwards.

**Andrew** (02:05:45): Yeah, that's what we've done.

**Bryan** (02:05:47): It's so pretty.

**Andrew** (02:05:48): All right.

**Andrew** (02:05:49): The reference holes are on this side.

**Bryan** (02:05:51): Yeah.

**Andrew** (02:05:51): So they just treated it like they'll.

**Bryan** (02:05:53): Have been on last year.

**Bryan** (02:05:54): We got to scrap a 3, 8.

**Bryan** (02:05:55): Can you find one?

**Andrew** (02:06:06): So close.

**Bryan** (02:06:07): Could almost reuse this, but it would be like.

**Andrew** (02:06:11): Yeah.

**Andrew** (02:06:12): And the holes will pop through.

**Bryan** (02:06:20): Send me a text if you find a scrap of 38 of what size?

**Andrew** (02:06:26): If you find a scrap of 3.

**Andrew** (02:06:27): 8.

**Andrew** (02:06:27): What size?

**Andrew** (02:06:28): Oh, anything we missed?

**Andrew** (02:06:32): The floor ceiling.

**Bryan** (02:06:33): It's a combination of the two.

**Bryan** (02:06:34): You have toe kick, you have end panels, you have crown, you have appliances in them, you have odd openings.

**Andrew** (02:06:43): I think that covers everything.

**Andrew** (02:06:44): Right.

**Andrew** (02:06:46): And that's a good base to start anyway.

**Andrew** (02:06:48): You can modify it as we move.

**Andrew** (02:06:49): Yeah.

**Andrew** (02:06:50): So now that you've filled all of that in, we have.

**Andrew** (02:06:55): What do we achieve out of that?

**Andrew** (02:06:57): A lot.

**Bryan** (02:06:58): Especially if we get like PDF uploads to the point where we get a group of tasks that can go to like a Levi or Shane.

**Bryan** (02:07:04): A task breakdown could be.

**Bryan** (02:07:07): So in there, we're gonna have cabinets labeled, we're gonna have a job labeled.

**Andrew** (02:07:10): We're gonna have correct all the things.

**Bryan** (02:07:12): That need to get happen.

**Andrew** (02:07:12): So just so you know, so I'm not having you double work is when you draw annotation in, it's going to grab that section and group it.

**Bryan** (02:07:24): To the room, group it to the.

**Andrew** (02:07:25): Cabinet run, group it to the thing.

**Andrew** (02:07:27): So when you're drawing a cabinet in, it'll draw the.

**Andrew** (02:07:29): It's grabbing the plan view of that cabinet.

**Andrew** (02:07:32): When you draw the elevation, it's grabbing that and attaching it to the cabinet.

**Andrew** (02:07:36): So you get.

**Andrew** (02:07:37): That's why I'm having.

**Andrew** (02:07:37): That's why I built this so that when you're going through the door at one time and then we extract all the information out.

**Bryan** (02:07:47): There.

**Andrew** (02:07:50): What else is missing from the sheet.
