**Bryan** (01:45:36): Dimension drawing, however, gets produced later when.

**Andrew** (01:45:38): They come back and ask you questions.

**Andrew** (01:45:40): What are the common questions they ask?

**Bryan** (01:45:42): It's a dimension that I forgot to pull.

**Andrew** (01:45:46): So those are the things I need right now.

**Andrew** (01:45:48): So what are those things that I get?

**Andrew** (01:45:50): I have to get you to have.

**Andrew** (01:45:52): You must have.

**Bryan** (01:45:54): They're not universal.

**Bryan** (01:45:56): And the reason is phase frames aren't universal.

**Bryan** (01:45:59): Like, these are really simple ones, but if you get into a more complicated.

**Bryan** (01:46:07): Let's Maybe pulp is.

**Bryan** (01:46:08): Yeah, pulp is a good example.

**Bryan** (01:46:11): You don't have here.

**Bryan** (01:46:17): Consistent like this.

**Bryan** (01:46:19): This is nice.

**Bryan** (01:46:21): You could easily tell them an overall height and overall interior width, overall interior lower height, overall interior upper height.

**Andrew** (01:46:29): I don't need that.

**Andrew** (01:46:31): I need you to give me the three fields that you want to be able to tell them without having to tell them.

**Andrew** (01:46:38): I'm not asking for a universal word for everything.

**Andrew** (01:46:40): I'm asking for the fields that you would want to tell them in any way that you want.
