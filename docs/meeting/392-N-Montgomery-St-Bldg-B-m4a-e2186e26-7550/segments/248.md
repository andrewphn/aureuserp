## Transcript

**Andrew** (02:34:11): But sourcing can start.

**Andrew** (02:34:13): Do you want sourcing to start?

**Andrew** (02:34:15): At what level?

**Bryan** (02:34:16): Kind of new tandem.

**Andrew** (02:34:19): Yeah, boy.

**Bryan** (02:34:20): Sorry.

**Andrew** (02:34:22): He's definitely not done these three.

**Andrew** (02:34:24): Shaggy dead.

**Andrew** (02:34:25): One of them might be.

**Andrew** (02:34:35): Oh.

**Bryan** (02:34:40): The double sided one you're talking about the one in.

**Andrew** (02:34:43): Yeah.

**Bryan** (02:34:49): That guy.

**Andrew** (02:34:50): Stop.

**Andrew** (02:34:50): It looks familiar.

**Bryan** (02:34:59): That one is done.

**Andrew** (02:35:02): The double sided one is not okay.

**Bryan** (02:35:05): Because I ran.

**Bryan** (02:35:06): We ran out of SHIELD now if you open up the.

**Bryan** (02:35:11): The picture of the double sided one.

**Andrew** (02:35:13): Yes.

**Andrew** (02:35:13): I don't know.

**Bryan** (02:35:17): I believe I text you a picture that has more on it.

**Andrew** (02:35:20): Yeah.

**Bryan** (02:35:21): So that should be the file that's on there.

**Andrew** (02:35:30): It's working great.

**Andrew** (02:35:32): Like, compared to what it used to be.

**Andrew** (02:35:35): Oh yeah.

**Andrew** (02:35:37): Like he's coming in with references and like.

**Andrew** (02:35:39): Anyway, no.

**Andrew** (02:35:42): To go to sourcing, you don't need the job card yet.

**Andrew** (02:35:46): So you should be triggering sourcing per prior to starting work on this.

**Andrew** (02:35:50): Am I right?

**Andrew** (02:35:52): Right.

**Bryan** (02:35:52): Design and sourcing are going to kind of happen around the same time.

**Bryan** (02:35:54): Once money's in, we can buy stuff.

**Andrew** (02:35:55): But we don't know what's in.
