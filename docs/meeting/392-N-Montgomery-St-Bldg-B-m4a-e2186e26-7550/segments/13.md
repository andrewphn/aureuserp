**Andrew** (06:32): Make.

**Bryan** (06:32): These little tops with.

**Bryan** (06:33): Because they gotta finish at three quarter.

**Bryan** (06:43): So he has not started these ones yet.

**Bryan** (07:59): Fair sad.

**Bryan** (08:01): Were they playing?

**Bryan** (08:02): They're supposed to crush where they're playing.

**Andrew** (08:05): Well, I hope they do it.

**Andrew** (08:10): I really thought they were doing better than CEO.

**Andrew** (08:12): Yeah.

**Andrew** (08:13): Yeah.

**Andrew** (08:14): You said 24 and a half.

**Bryan** (08:17): Making 24 and a half.

**Andrew** (08:19): Yeah.

**Bryan** (08:19): So that one's unspread.

**Bryan** (08:24): It's weird.

**Bryan** (08:24): I wonder why.

**Bryan** (08:25): This one needs spread.

**Bryan** (08:27): Oh, you're right.

**Bryan** (08:28): Because it's got solid back.

**Bryan** (08:30): Probably doesn't need to be.

**Andrew** (08:31): Need to be 24.

**Andrew** (08:32): They could probably be a little less.

**Andrew** (08:35): You want it to be flush with this or come out.

**Bryan** (08:36): It's going to be flush with that.

**Andrew** (08:40): But you're really using.

**Bryan** (08:41): So just at least behind that.

**Andrew** (08:43): Yeah.

**Bryan** (08:43): So if you're at 23 quarter.

**Andrew** (09:18): Okay.
