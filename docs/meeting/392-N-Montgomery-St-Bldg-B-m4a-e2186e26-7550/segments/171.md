**Andrew** (01:48:00): No, I mean like as in when you're drawing it, are you always drawing it this way?

**Andrew** (01:48:04): Are you making sure that everything is labeled?

**Bryan** (01:48:08): Yeah.

**Andrew** (01:48:11): So that's all I really needed because I don't need you to write two and a half down in here.
