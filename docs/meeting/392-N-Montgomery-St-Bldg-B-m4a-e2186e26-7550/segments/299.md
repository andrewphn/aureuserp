Discussion about training

## Transcript

**Andrew** (03:00:45): From a learning point of view, her documenting it so it's learnable.

**Andrew** (03:00:50): I have a template for her to fill in on how to do something.

**Andrew** (03:00:54): So I'll send that to you later today.

**Andrew** (03:00:55): I already have it.

**Andrew** (03:00:57): It's literally a.

**Andrew** (03:00:58): It's like a job card.

**Andrew** (03:00:59): It's just a step sheet where she.

**Andrew** (03:01:01): She could write step one, step two.

**Andrew** (03:01:03): Now tell me how I could modify that and what you would want that to look like.

**Bryan** (03:01:08): I don't know what it looks like.

**Andrew** (03:01:09): Like.

**Andrew** (03:01:09): Think of it like a recipe card for the job.

**Bryan** (03:01:12): You just described the job card.

**Andrew** (03:01:14): That card only has.

**Andrew** (03:01:16): Doesn't have a step by step.

**Bryan** (03:01:17): It does.

**Andrew** (03:01:18): Oh, and this top corner.

**Andrew** (03:01:19): Yeah.

**Andrew** (03:01:21): I don't want you to pre write it unless you want to pre write.

**Andrew** (03:01:28): She has to be able to articulate like her schedule of learning should be.

**Andrew** (03:01:32): A part of it is you demonstrating it.

**Andrew** (03:01:34): A part of her is doing it and then writing it down and reviewing.

**Andrew** (03:01:39): Unless you're gonna watch her do it.

**Bryan** (03:01:41): Yeah, I'm doing it with her.

**Andrew** (03:01:43): So you're gonna do each step at the same time together.

**Andrew** (03:01:46): Okay.

**Andrew** (03:01:47): Because she needs to like.

**Andrew** (03:01:49): Part of that reinforcement is writing down and we need her written down.

**Andrew** (03:01:52): So if you're already doing that, then we're already gonna make the training period.

**Bryan** (03:01:57): I was gonna write it down.

**Bryan** (03:01:58): All the test cards.

**Andrew** (03:02:01): She still has to write something.

**Andrew** (03:02:03): Put like the methodology down.

**Andrew** (03:02:06): Your task cards need to be simple.

**Andrew** (03:02:10): That's how I would train, if that's what you're asking.

**Andrew** (03:02:13): Yeah, that's the most effective way.

**Bryan** (03:02:15): So just put down the task and just have her fill it out as we're going.

**Bryan** (03:02:19): Okay.

**Andrew** (03:02:22): It saves you all work and then writes it in a language that she understands and not.

**Andrew** (03:02:26): It's not about you.

**Bryan** (03:02:28): Okay.

**Andrew** (03:02:29): What.

**Andrew** (03:02:29): What else is there that you need help with Her.

**Andrew** (03:02:36): What I would say lesson one is explain this to her.

**Andrew** (03:02:42): This column.

**Andrew** (03:02:43): How we do things.

**Andrew** (03:02:45): So first thing for her.

**Andrew** (03:02:47): Welcome.
