Discussion about production

## Transcript

**Andrew** (15:33): Actually no, I would put at the start of production because it is a separate task.

**Andrew** (15:39): You could technically break those tasks apart.

**Andrew** (15:41): I just need someone to go back and review the files.

**Bryan** (15:45): It's making job cards, what you're doing at that point.

**Andrew** (15:48): Yeah, but it's not just making job cards because it's.

**Andrew** (15:51): Oh, no, it is making jobs.

**Andrew** (15:52): Yeah.

**Andrew** (15:53): Correct.

**Andrew** (15:53): Yeah, 100%.

**Andrew** (15:54): So make job cards.

**Andrew** (16:00): I wouldn't call it a job card make.

**Andrew** (16:04): It is a job card, but it's a bundle, which is all of that stuff.

**Andrew** (16:10): There needs to be a bundle that can just be handed over and it has everything you need in there.

**Andrew** (16:15): It should be all details except financial.

**Andrew** (16:18): Basically, like from the floor, I should be able to.

**Andrew** (16:24): Let's say that we missed a step along the way.
