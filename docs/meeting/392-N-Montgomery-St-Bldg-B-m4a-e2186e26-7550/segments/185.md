**Bryan** (01:58:55): Where it's going to come into play is when I draw a section view and that goes to the CNC for programming.

**Bryan** (01:59:02): So it's not like they're.

**Bryan** (01:59:03): They're never laying out and drilling.

**Andrew** (01:59:06): Yeah.

**Andrew** (01:59:07): It's already CNC, so.

**Bryan** (01:59:08): Yeah, I don't think it's 36.

**Andrew** (01:59:10): Okay, cool.
