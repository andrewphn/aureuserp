**Bryan** (02:46:53): I don't know.

**Andrew** (02:46:55): Like we've talked through it, but like, no.

**Andrew** (02:46:57): Like, is there anything you currently can.

**Andrew** (02:47:00): I know, but is there anything currently that you see wrong with this process?

**Andrew** (02:47:05): I don't know.

**Andrew** (02:47:06): I don't know.

**Bryan** (02:47:07): I think we need to do it and I'm sure not wrong.

**Bryan** (02:47:10): I don't think wrong's the right word.
