**Andrew** (01:44:50): But what I'm saying is, like, you do need to know the face frame, this stuff.

**Andrew** (01:44:57): You need to know how wide am I cutting the face frame?

**Andrew** (01:45:00): Like on the floor to minimize friction.

**Andrew** (01:45:03): If I'm told my face frame is this length and this width, I'm gonna cut that.

**Andrew** (01:45:11): But why is that?

**Andrew** (01:45:12): Is it relevant?

**Andrew** (01:45:13): Is it not relevant?

**Bryan** (01:45:15): It's too simplified.

**Bryan** (01:45:16): It's not the way it is.

**Andrew** (01:45:17): So how do I.

**Andrew** (01:45:18): How do we do it in a way that it is the way that, like, I need to have the feels that you would check with your eyes.

**Bryan** (01:45:25): All we need for them is make the face frame and a dimension drawing.

**Bryan** (01:45:30): So is there a face frame?

**Andrew** (01:45:31): Yes.

**Andrew** (01:45:33): Okay.

**Bryan** (01:45:33): Build the face frame is the task that comes out of it.
