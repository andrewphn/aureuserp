## Transcript

**Andrew** (02:49:13): Apart from designing a better process to make that happen, where's the instruction how to use it.

**Andrew** (02:49:21): How to use a change a number on a spreadsheet that McKenna already did one time.

**Andrew** (02:49:27): Like that instruction happened.

**Andrew** (02:49:29): Yeah, but I'm just saying.

**Andrew** (02:49:30): I'm just saying McKenna did it one time and McKenna was explained and taught how to use a spreadsheet and given all the information for it.

**Andrew** (02:49:40): But I'm telling you that motivation and the enforcement of structure is not something I can design.

**Bryan** (02:49:49): It's something you could outline.

**Andrew** (02:49:50): Yeah.

**Andrew** (02:49:51): And it was outlined to the person.

**Andrew** (02:49:53): But we.

**Andrew** (02:49:54): Then it was when we did it.

**Andrew** (02:49:57): Yeah.

**Bryan** (02:49:58): I have no idea when she's supposed to do it, how it was supposed to happen.

**Andrew** (02:50:02): Right, right.

**Andrew** (02:50:03): But we didn't discuss that.
