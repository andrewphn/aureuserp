**Andrew** (01:26:30): Okay, so what in drawers?

**Andrew** (01:26:36): Doors first.

**Andrew** (01:26:37): Because we didn't do measurements.

**Andrew** (01:26:38): What are we measuring?

**Andrew** (01:26:39): What do you need to.

**Andrew** (01:26:41): With those?

**Bryan** (01:26:43): Width, width, height, rail and style.

**Bryan** (01:26:46): Size.

**Andrew** (01:26:48): What size?

**Andrew** (01:26:49): Rail size.

**Bryan** (01:26:50): Rail and style.

**Andrew** (01:26:51): Rail and style.

**Andrew** (01:26:52): And what are you measuring on those though?

**Bryan** (01:26:54): Width.

**Andrew** (01:26:56): So we need the overall width and length.

**Andrew** (01:26:59): Yeah.

**Bryan** (01:26:59): And then you need the width of rail and styles.

**Bryan** (01:27:04): You have a 14 inch door with a two and a quarter rail and stain overlay.

**Andrew** (01:27:09): Is the rail ever different?

**Bryan** (01:27:12): Yes.

**Andrew** (01:27:13): From the top and the bottom pretty.

**Bryan** (01:27:15): Much just only on drawers.

**Andrew** (01:27:17): Okay.

**Andrew** (01:27:17): So you do need.

**Bryan** (01:27:19): What you need on doors.

**Bryan** (01:27:20): You don't need on doors.

**Bryan** (01:27:22): What you need on doors is check rail.

**Andrew** (01:27:24): Okay.

**Bryan** (01:27:24): And is there a check rail width?

**Bryan** (01:27:28): Okay, Is there a check rail?

**Andrew** (01:27:29): You set it up now.

**Andrew** (01:27:29): So I'll have that.

**Bryan** (01:27:30): What you need on drawers is top rail, bottom rail.

**Bryan** (01:27:37): And then your styles are probably gonna.

**Bryan** (01:27:39): Your styles will match your drawers.

**Andrew** (01:27:41): Okay.

**Andrew** (01:27:42): In terms of the.

**Andrew** (01:27:45): We missed it on the cabinet level too.

**Andrew** (01:27:48): What are the dimensional things we missed?

**Bryan** (01:27:52): Face frame widths.

**Andrew** (01:27:54): What else?

**Andrew** (01:27:54): The actual dimension.

**Andrew** (01:27:55): The box itself, too.

**Bryan** (01:27:57): Yeah.

**Andrew** (01:27:58): Overall height, overall width.

**Andrew** (01:28:00): Depth.

**Bryan** (01:28:03): Yeah, you need depth over, I guess overall height.

**Bryan** (01:28:07): Overall length is fine for.

**Andrew** (01:28:08): What about like, things like K height?

**Andrew** (01:28:11): Yeah, sure.

**Andrew** (01:28:12): Like what?

**Andrew** (01:28:12): No, what are the things you're overlooking that, like.

**Bryan** (01:28:15): Yeah, you could do K things that.

**Andrew** (01:28:16): If there are generic ones, that'll be automatic.

**Andrew** (01:28:18): But like, sometimes what things might have variation?

**Bryan** (01:28:20): Yeah, toe can have variation.

**Bryan** (01:28:23): Height can have variation.

**Bryan** (01:28:24): Depth can have variation openings.

**Bryan** (01:28:26): So you need your face frame dimensions.

**Andrew** (01:28:28): How do you record openings to the.

**Andrew** (01:28:30): To get a cut?

**Andrew** (01:28:32): Like, how do you.

**Andrew** (01:28:33): How do you say what the opening is?

**Andrew** (01:28:35): Like, what is the field that I would write that in?

**Bryan** (01:28:49): I would say at this spot, you.

**Bryan** (01:28:51): You pretty much just need overall height.

**Andrew** (01:28:54): Okay, so I'll give you an example.

**Andrew** (01:28:56): You told me to build you a base cabinet, and I have to build a face frame for this base cabinet.

**Andrew** (01:29:01): Okay.

**Andrew** (01:29:02): And to build a face frame for this base cabinet, what do I need to know?

**Bryan** (01:29:06): A lot more than just openings.

**Andrew** (01:29:08): What is it you need?

**Bryan** (01:29:10): You need to know Your face frame doesn't match your cabinet width.

**Bryan** (01:29:15): Okay.

**Bryan** (01:29:16): So your face frame is completely separate from your cabinet.

**Andrew** (01:29:18): So what is that difference and how do I know?

**Bryan** (01:29:20): The difference varies?
