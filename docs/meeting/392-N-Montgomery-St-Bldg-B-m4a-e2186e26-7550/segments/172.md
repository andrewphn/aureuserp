**Andrew** (01:48:23): That for every face frame, it has all the specs that someone would need.

**Andrew** (01:48:27): How do I make sure that happens?

**Bryan** (01:48:29): So maybe the better thing to do at this juncture, which would lead right to a job card anyway, is for me to pull all these dimensions, make the printable PDF and upload it.

**Bryan** (01:48:42): And have a spot for an upload?

**Andrew** (01:48:44): Yes, Correct.

**Andrew** (01:48:44): So the base range needs a PDF upload.

**Bryan** (01:48:46): Yeah.

**Andrew** (01:48:47): Okay, cool.

**Bryan** (01:48:48): That is the simplest.

**Andrew** (01:48:49): Okay, that's easy.

**Andrew** (01:48:52): Do you want to go get lunch?

**Andrew** (01:48:56): The perfect place is down the street.

**Bryan** (01:48:57): Just.

**Andrew** (01:48:57): Just go out there and grab it.

**Andrew** (01:48:59): If you grab me something to anything, they're good as long as it doesn't have avocado in it and.

**Bryan** (01:49:02): Yeah, extra avocado.

**Bryan** (01:49:04): Extra beef?

**Andrew** (01:49:05): Yeah.

**Bryan** (01:49:05): Extra avocado.

**Andrew** (01:49:06): Yeah.

**Andrew** (01:49:08): It's literally.

**Andrew** (01:49:08): It's down the street.

**Andrew** (01:49:09): You eaten already?

**Andrew** (01:49:10): Yeah, yeah, just grab me that.

**Andrew** (01:49:13): How'd you go shooting stuff?

**Andrew** (01:49:14): Did you get a bunch of stuff?

**Andrew** (01:49:15): Yeah.

**Andrew** (01:49:17): Easy enough.

**Andrew** (01:49:17): All right, do that.

**Andrew** (01:49:19): I'll probably be through a lot by the time you get back.

**Andrew** (01:49:22): All right, sweet.

**Bryan** (01:49:22): Thanks, bro.

**Bryan** (01:49:24): Thank you.

**Andrew** (01:49:28): Ok, so back to.

**Bryan** (01:49:31): I like that idea.

**Bryan** (01:49:32): I like to have this database at this point and then to upload A PDF?

**Bryan** (01:49:36): Yeah, I think that's a really good way.

**Bryan** (01:49:39): I see that as a solution for.

**Andrew** (01:49:41): A lot of things.

**Andrew** (01:49:41): Yeah, that's already there.

**Andrew** (01:49:44): I just needed to understand was there any kind of figures that I need to pull out?

**Bryan** (01:49:52): I think the information that you're getting at this juncture with that tool for linear footage is more associated with money.

**Andrew** (01:50:00): No, I'm thinking from.

**Andrew** (01:50:01): From a point of view of, like, if I'm cutting a door, let's say.

**Andrew** (01:50:05): Let's say we can't see and see, and I'm cutting a door, I need to know about the door.

**Bryan** (01:50:10): I need to do the same thing.

**Bryan** (01:50:11): Then I need to have a PDF upload for that cabinet.

**Bryan** (01:50:15): Because what I do is I do this layer here and I do all my door dimensions and I put them on here.

**Bryan** (01:50:22): So it'd be like.

**Andrew** (01:50:23): It reinforces my point that each cabinet really should have its own rhino.

**Andrew** (01:50:30): Like, from a practical point of view, that's what makes the most logical sense.

**Andrew** (01:50:37): Because you would isolate yours, you would isolate all the other things from it.

**Andrew** (01:50:43): Or at worst, why can't you write.

**Bryan** (01:50:45): A script where maybe, like, we have a template that has a label up here and then it can identify that within this frame is.

**Bryan** (01:50:53): And then it can all be in one spot.

**Andrew** (01:50:57): Yeah, Let me get what you're saying.

**Bryan** (01:51:00): Layer all these in here as a room number, a cabinet number or something.

**Bryan** (01:51:07): Okay.

**Andrew** (01:51:08): No, yeah, I'll think through that.

**Andrew** (01:51:10): Okay, so back to specs doors we've done right drawers, what are the draw things that you would fill in?

**Andrew** (01:51:17): Imagine you're doing draws.
