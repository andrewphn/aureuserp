Discussion about cabinet

## Transcript

**Andrew** (01:59:17): No, the length, width, depth comes from the cabinet.

**Andrew** (01:59:22): Oh.

**Andrew** (01:59:22): Which tells me cabinet needs external and internal length away.

**Bryan** (01:59:26): 77 in ISO.

**Bryan** (01:59:28): So.

**Bryan** (01:59:29): So again you're gonna have like.

**Bryan** (01:59:31): If you're looking at a plan view of a cabinet, you're gonna have an overall but then you're gonna have openings.

**Bryan** (01:59:37): Correct?

**Andrew** (01:59:38): Right.

**Andrew** (01:59:39): So I just labeled it differently.

**Andrew** (01:59:41): It was internal and external, but we'll just call it open.

**Andrew** (01:59:43): So openings, what else?

**Andrew** (01:59:48): So that's base.

**Andrew** (01:59:50): Any other.

**Bryan** (01:59:55): All that's there.

**Bryan** (01:59:55): So I just was curious about what.

**Andrew** (01:59:57): Just give me the kick stuff again.

**Andrew** (01:59:59): Kick height, kick depth, what else?

**Bryan** (02:00:06): If we're considering like an appliance, could be.

**Andrew** (02:00:09): Yeah.

**Bryan** (02:00:09): A toe kick as well.

**Bryan** (02:00:11): Yeah, I guess.

**Bryan** (02:00:12): Whether it's loose or fixed.

**Andrew** (02:00:14): What's loose or fixed?

**Bryan** (02:00:15): Send a piece loose.

**Andrew** (02:00:17): Okay.

**Bryan** (02:00:17): Or send it attached to the cabinet.

**Andrew** (02:00:20): Do we.

**Andrew** (02:00:21): Do you need a field to say that this is the toe kick height, this is the toe kick depth is what I'm asking.

**Andrew** (02:00:28): And there'll be default values in there.

**Bryan** (02:00:30): That will be defined on the PDF of the face frame.

**Bryan** (02:00:34): Because a face frame will commonly come all the way to the ground and it'll have that defined there.

**Bryan** (02:00:40): Okay.

**Andrew** (02:00:40): Okay.

**Andrew** (02:00:42): Okay.

**Andrew** (02:00:43): Yeah.

**Bryan** (02:00:43): Okay.

**Bryan** (02:00:43): The one I showed you did not come to the ground, but it will.

**Andrew** (02:00:47): Okay.

**Andrew** (02:00:48): Okay.

**Andrew** (02:00:50): Any other.

**Andrew** (02:00:50): Okay.

**Andrew** (02:00:51): Appliance.

**Andrew** (02:00:52): Let's do the appliance type.

**Bryan** (02:00:54): What is that like a fridge with panels, a dishwasher with panels, Wine fridge, that kind of stuff.

**Andrew** (02:01:01): Yeah, but like what are we calling what.

**Andrew** (02:01:04): What fields do you need from it?

**Bryan** (02:01:08): Brand would be good.

**Bryan** (02:01:09): Oh, okay.

**Andrew** (02:01:10): So you need.

**Andrew** (02:01:10): You need actual appliance details.

**Bryan** (02:01:12): Yeah.

**Bryan** (02:01:13): Because how they mount can be different.

**Andrew** (02:01:15): Okay.

**Andrew** (02:01:15): So appliance details.

**Andrew** (02:01:17): And then you need a final area where you actually give the spec or the thing that you cut and tell me what that looks like.

**Bryan** (02:01:25): The final area where I'm giving the spec for.

**Bryan** (02:01:26): I'm cutting.

**Andrew** (02:01:27): Yes.
