## Transcript

**Andrew** (02:20:40): I started doing oak tops and I know that I'm ahead there, but I just need to wait for Shane to get the files to cut the CNC and then combine the two.

**Andrew** (02:20:48): For productivity point of view, I would prefer that you stop and not be cutting things for half an hour.

**Andrew** (02:20:54): If you planned it out, if you spent that half an hour and looked at what it is that you plan to do and then execute the plan rather than do it right.

**Andrew** (02:21:02): That's my like I know from a productivity point of view that's the best way to do it.

**Bryan** (02:21:08): They do that.

**Bryan** (02:21:09): You always get the place.

**Bryan** (02:21:10): You sit down.

**Bryan** (02:21:11): I mean we go through them and.

**Andrew** (02:21:12): Know what we want to do.

**Andrew** (02:21:13): But not every.

**Andrew** (02:21:14): Because here's what I mean.

**Andrew** (02:21:15): Look.

**Andrew** (02:21:16): So let's say you're building something upper and it needs crown.

**Andrew** (02:21:19): Okay.

**Andrew** (02:21:19): You're going to part out the crown making.

**Andrew** (02:21:22): For example, I need you to actually make the task for crown making.

**Andrew** (02:21:27): So and then assign it before you like and not do it on the fly.

**Andrew** (02:21:31): I think I have this before Levi.
