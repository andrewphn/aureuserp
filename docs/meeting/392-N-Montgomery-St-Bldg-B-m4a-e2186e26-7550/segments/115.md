**Andrew** (01:10:32): I can spit layers, I can spit anything that we have defined in any way that you want in Rhino.

**Andrew** (01:10:39): I have the way right now to make a Rhino file with pre made layers custom every time.

**Andrew** (01:10:46): I can already do it.

**Andrew** (01:10:47): I have a way that I. I can import pages in and have that set up in the way that you need it to.

**Andrew** (01:10:56): And so my goal is, what I need you inside Rhino is the things that you don't have measurements for to in Rhino.

**Andrew** (01:11:07): Just draw it in a very specific way that I can program a computer to read those things every time.

**Andrew** (01:11:16): That's what I need.

**Andrew** (01:11:17): But right now the manual way is you have to fill in the form with those details.

**Andrew** (01:11:24): Now what are those fields that you need to get the job done?

**Andrew** (01:11:30): That's what I need to get from you in right up.

**Andrew** (01:11:33): Yeah.
