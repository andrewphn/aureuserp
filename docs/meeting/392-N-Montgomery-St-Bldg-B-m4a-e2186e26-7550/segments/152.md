Discussion about cabinet

## Transcript

**Andrew** (01:38:30): You're actually drawing the cabinet itself first.

**Andrew** (01:38:34): The actual empty shelves with no filling.

**Andrew** (01:38:36): And then you're drawing a face frame, and then you're drawing all the stuff inside because you need the actual cabinet as well before you can draw a face frame.

**Bryan** (01:38:46): No, now I'm going into a room, and if there's casing here, this phase frame is going to be two and three quarter wide instead of an inch and three quarter wide.

**Bryan** (01:38:54): This is my center line.

**Bryan** (01:38:55): So these openings are going to get divided into two, and they're 18 and 7, 8 each.

**Bryan** (01:38:59): I'm doing all my openings first.

**Andrew** (01:39:01): Right, so you're not doing face frame first.

**Bryan** (01:39:03): It is my face frame.

**Bryan** (01:39:04): All my openings are on my face frame.

**Andrew** (01:39:09): Because I just want to make sure the uppercut.
