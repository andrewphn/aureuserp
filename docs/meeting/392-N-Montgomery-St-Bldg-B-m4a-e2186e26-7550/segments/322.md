Discussion about inventory

## Transcript

**Andrew** (03:11:48): Like office supplies, wipes, sponges.

**Andrew** (03:11:53): We have consumables, like screw bits.

**Andrew** (03:11:55): Yeah, Yeah.

**Andrew** (03:12:02): I think we're okay, Brian.

**Andrew** (03:12:05): I don't.

**Bryan** (03:12:05): I don't disagree.

**Andrew** (03:12:06): Yeah, it's.

**Andrew** (03:12:07): It's just still.

**Bryan** (03:12:08): I feel the same malleable.

**Bryan** (03:12:10): It's a great idea spot.

**Bryan** (03:12:12): And I'm still like, no.

**Andrew** (03:12:16): I think the thing that's hard for most, and we've discussed this, is you are only looking at.

**Andrew** (03:12:23): We don't have a product.

**Bryan** (03:12:25): I don't think so personally, because I feel like I have micro products in a proposal, an invoice, a time card.

**Bryan** (03:12:35): I can't even edit them.

**Bryan** (03:12:38): Like, I can't change Alina's name.

**Andrew** (03:12:40): Right.

**Andrew** (03:12:41): Well, yeah, so I think that's what.

**Bryan** (03:12:43): It's not that it's just like the end product.

**Andrew** (03:12:47): Well, like, technically you can just use a pencil, scratch it out and edit it.

**Andrew** (03:12:52): Yes.

**Andrew** (03:12:53): You don't have a digital.

**Andrew** (03:12:54): Yes, but I'm just saying, you know, we're not.

**Andrew** (03:13:02): Yeah, yeah, no, I get what you're saying.

**Andrew** (03:13:06): Like, the thing is there are always.

**Andrew** (03:13:09): You've been in the practice of workarounds for a long time, so.

**Andrew** (03:13:12): Yes.

**Andrew** (03:13:13): So could you do a proposal the old way?

**Andrew** (03:13:16): Yeah, you could.

**Andrew** (03:13:18): There's nothing stopping you from doing that.

**Andrew** (03:13:20): But the nice way and the clean way.

**Andrew** (03:13:23): Yeah, we don't have that yet.

**Andrew** (03:13:24): Now, like, parts of me, I even thinking in my mind, it's never gonna be as nice as how I'm doing it for you right now.

**Bryan** (03:13:33): That's okay.

**Andrew** (03:13:33): But that's not good, right?

**Bryan** (03:13:35): That's okay.

**Andrew** (03:13:36): It just needs to be what is going to be 100.
