**Andrew** (03:03:51): What do you expect her to do?

**Bryan** (03:03:52): Every day she's gonna come in and report to Shaggy and Levi and figure out what to do.

**Andrew** (03:04:00): That's fine.

**Andrew** (03:04:01): So you can just tell that you can be like, hey.

**Andrew** (03:04:03): So two ways you'll get tasks.

**Andrew** (03:04:04): A, you know, we're a small business, it's going to be versatile but you'll either get specific tasks that's already been assigned, that's pre allocated to a project and this is the proper way.

**Andrew** (03:04:14): But they're like any small business you're going to have to be on hand and ready to go with whatever and they will make sure to explain to you what that is and eventually just the subtask, you'll get a subtask list.

**Andrew** (03:04:32): Yeah, it's easy.
