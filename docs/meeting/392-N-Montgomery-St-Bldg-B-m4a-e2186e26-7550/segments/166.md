**Bryan** (01:43:28): Okay.

**Bryan** (01:43:28): Or six.

**Bryan** (01:43:29): Sorry.

**Andrew** (01:43:30): So you're adding.

**Andrew** (01:43:31): Now you have to spec these seven, six openings.

**Andrew** (01:43:34): So do you want to define.

**Andrew** (01:43:36): Do you want to work in a linear way where you're like, these are.

**Andrew** (01:43:40): This is drawer one, and I'm a spec.

**Andrew** (01:43:41): All of drawer one.

**Andrew** (01:43:42): Or do you want to say there are six openings and then work through.

**Bryan** (01:43:45): Them the first way where this is drawer one, standard.

**Bryan** (01:43:51): Drawer two, standard.

**Bryan** (01:43:52): Drawer three, trash pullout, drawer four, cutlery inside.

**Andrew** (01:43:57): Okay.

**Bryan** (01:43:57): So.

**Andrew** (01:43:58): But also, what else do I need to know apart from the openings?

**Andrew** (01:44:02): You're missing the global part.

**Andrew** (01:44:04): Like new cabinet.

**Andrew** (01:44:06): What does a blind person need to know about new cabinet?

**Bryan** (01:44:10): I thought we already did that.

**Andrew** (01:44:11): Yeah, but that's what I'm saying to you because you're contradicting me with your.

**Andrew** (01:44:15): So I need to know face frame, what are the other categories?

**Andrew** (01:44:21): So we have overall length and width and depth.

**Andrew** (01:44:26): And then we have face frame length, width, and that's inside face frame spec.

**Andrew** (01:44:31): But what are the other spec categories?
