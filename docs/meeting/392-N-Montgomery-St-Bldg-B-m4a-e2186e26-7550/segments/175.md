Discussion about sourcing

## Transcript

**Bryan** (01:51:46): Because for drawers, we don't make them, we order them.

**Bryan** (01:51:48): So this is going down a different path to purchasing.

**Bryan** (01:51:52): So, like for this one here, and it could be drawn this way, but Blum is 5:16 offset from the size of your opening every single time, either side.

**Andrew** (01:52:04): So is that connected to hardware?

**Bryan** (01:52:07): Yes, it is connected to hardware.

**Bryan** (01:52:10): So, you know, depth.

**Bryan** (01:52:11): Depth tells you hardware because it's blunt.
