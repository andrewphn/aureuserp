**Bryan** (27:22): He needs drawings.

**Andrew** (27:23): Yeah.

**Bryan** (27:27): PDF, Hardware, Site access.

**Andrew** (27:49): Okay, so take a step back, look at the bullet.

**Andrew** (27:52): What are we missing?

**Andrew** (27:53): Just run through it logically.

**Bryan** (27:57): One of the things I feel that we're missing right now is like the project summary startup, which would be like making the folder or making the job page or whatever it is to look at to where everything goes to.

**Andrew** (28:14): huh.

**Bryan** (28:15): I don't think that's mapped out.

**Bryan** (28:17): That's something like literally just duplicating the folder, putting the name, making a job number is a weird pinch point right now.

**Andrew** (28:25): Okay, so cool.

**Andrew** (28:28): That's a fair point.

**Bryan** (28:29): Yeah.

**Andrew** (28:31): But if you had to do this completely on paper.

**Andrew** (28:33): Let's just erase any kind of system that we have right now.

**Andrew** (28:37): Let's talk about the ins and outs to make this work.

**Andrew** (28:41): Let's say they're all completely independent.
