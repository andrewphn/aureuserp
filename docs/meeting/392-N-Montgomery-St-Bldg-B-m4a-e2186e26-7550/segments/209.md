Discussion about inventory

## Transcript

**Andrew** (02:12:45): Of inventory stock that you want to hold for emergencies versus allocatable?

**Andrew** (02:12:57): I mean, like, if something comes in and, like, the inventory person goes, yeah, we've got 20 sheets.

**Andrew** (02:13:03): I shouldn't allow him to take 20 sheets because what if something goes wrong in this other job?

**Bryan** (02:13:11): Oh, I don't think we really have that.

**Bryan** (02:13:13): Everything's accessible right now.

**Bryan** (02:13:17): You know what I mean?
