**Andrew** (01:20:15): But do you want to say like at the cabinet run level, it's all the same hardware.

**Andrew** (01:20:20): Do you want to say it at the cabinet level?

**Andrew** (01:20:23): Every piece of hardware in this cabinet is this.

**Andrew** (01:20:25): Or do you want it at the component level?

**Bryan** (01:20:28): What is the component?

**Andrew** (01:20:29): Doors.

**Bryan** (01:20:30): It has to be at the component level.

**Bryan** (01:20:31): Because in one cabinet you could have a blind door and a regular door.

**Bryan** (01:20:34): So it has to be at the component level.

**Andrew** (01:20:37): Okay, cool.

**Andrew** (01:20:38): So you gotta.

**Andrew** (01:20:39): So you're gonna do that at the component level?

**Bryan** (01:20:41): Yes.

**Bryan** (01:20:41): And let's say we have a vanity where the top drawer has to be shallow.

**Bryan** (01:20:44): So each of those as a component.

**Bryan** (01:20:46): So they would each be defined.

**Bryan** (01:20:46): So it has to be at the component level.

**Andrew** (01:20:48): Okay.

**Bryan** (01:20:48): So it could have.

**Bryan** (01:20:49): You could do at the beginning.

**Bryan** (01:20:50): Like this is all blum inset hardware and you have to change it.

**Bryan** (01:20:54): That'd be fine.

**Andrew** (01:20:54): Okay.

**Bryan** (01:20:55): Because it is predominantly inset blum and it is predominantly 21 inch slides and it's predominantly cert something.

**Andrew** (01:21:01): So I'll have a default that you can set at any level.

**Andrew** (01:21:04): So at the cabinet run level, you can have a default to like, I'm selecting this piece of harbor anticipated.

**Bryan** (01:21:09): Harbor.

**Andrew** (01:21:10): Yes.

**Andrew** (01:21:11): Cool, cool.

**Andrew** (01:21:12): Okay, so we've done doors, drawers.

**Andrew** (01:21:15): Tell me about it.

**Bryan** (01:21:16): You don't type.

**Bryan** (01:21:17): So we can do.

**Andrew** (01:21:18): Oh, forgot, door dimensions.

**Andrew** (01:21:21): What are the door dimensions?

**Bryan** (01:21:23): Yeah, they're not pulled on this PDFs.

**Andrew** (01:21:24): Yeah, but I need.

**Andrew** (01:21:25): I need that what is in the final.
