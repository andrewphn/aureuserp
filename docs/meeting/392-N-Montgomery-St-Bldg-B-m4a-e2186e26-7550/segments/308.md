**Andrew** (03:05:18): So if that's inculcated then that's great.

**Andrew** (03:05:20): That's probably the culture inculcation that is important.

**Andrew** (03:05:25): What else am I thinking of about her?

**Bryan** (03:05:27): Is there anything else, Brian?

**Andrew** (03:05:29): That's how I would do it at least.

**Andrew** (03:05:32): How many tasks do you have per day?

**Andrew** (03:05:33): Just One or like what's your plan?

**Bryan** (03:05:35): No, probably like six to eight.

**Andrew** (03:05:38): Six to eight in one day?

**Andrew** (03:05:41): Dude, that's a lot.

**Andrew** (03:05:43): Yeah.

**Andrew** (03:06:07): Don't like just sit flammable.

**Andrew** (03:06:11): Is there a sequence?

**Andrew** (03:06:12): Show me the toss.

**Bryan** (03:06:24): Who knows where it is?

**Andrew** (03:06:32): What's actually coming into Monday?

**Andrew** (03:06:35): Come in on Monday.

**Andrew** (03:06:36): I'll come in on Monday just to do the intro and then I'll leave the rest to you after that.
