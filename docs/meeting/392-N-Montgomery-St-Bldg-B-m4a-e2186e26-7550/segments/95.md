## Transcript

**Andrew** (59:01): So at the cabinet run level, tell me what specifications I need to include so you can fill it in.

**Andrew** (59:13): So that includes.

**Andrew** (59:14): So let's go through that together.

**Andrew** (59:15): Can you grab something to write on.

**Bryan** (59:16): A number of magnets?

**Andrew** (59:19): Use Sankity in front of you or use friendship lane, or use one of them in front of you so that we can do this.

**Andrew** (59:30): Now you won't do linear feeds at the cabinet run level.

**Andrew** (59:34): You'll do it at the cabinet level, and then it'll escalate up to the cabinet run.

**Andrew** (59:46): Actually draw this.

**Andrew** (59:47): Yeah.

**Andrew** (59:47): Okay, so we have project.

**Bryan** (59:53): We have room.

**Andrew** (59:59): Then we have room location, we have cabinet run.

**Andrew** (01:00:10): Then we have cabinet, and then we have.

**Andrew** (01:00:14): Which is.

**Andrew** (01:00:16): Haven't done yet, but like sub cabin.

**Andrew** (01:00:23): And that's like doors and so on and so forth.

**Andrew** (01:00:26): Okay, so at the project level, we have customer details.

**Andrew** (01:00:30): Access.

**Andrew** (01:00:32): Right?

**Andrew** (01:00:34): At the room level, we have access.

**Andrew** (01:00:37): We have.

**Andrew** (01:00:38): What do we agree to access?

**Andrew** (01:00:42): That's really all we need for a room, you know?

**Andrew** (01:00:47): Yeah, that's basic.

**Andrew** (01:00:48): Yeah.

**Andrew** (01:00:49): Location, we have electrical and plumbing and wind fixtures.

**Andrew** (01:01:00): Okay.

**Andrew** (01:01:01): And then at the cabinet run level, that's where dividing tops and bottoms and tall.

**Bryan** (01:01:08): Okay.

**Andrew** (01:01:09): Right.

**Andrew** (01:01:09): What am I defining here?

**Andrew** (01:01:11): So I feel like cabinet run level has floor to ceiling, like for.

**Andrew** (01:01:16): For like tall, explicitly.

**Andrew** (01:01:18): So what.

**Andrew** (01:01:19): What types am I missing?

**Bryan** (01:01:21): Yeah, Base cabinets, upper cabinets, pantry, cabinets, appliances.

**Andrew** (01:01:25): What's pantry?

**Bryan** (01:01:27): A floor ceiling.

**Andrew** (01:01:27): So we just call it full because that could be a closet.

**Andrew** (01:01:31): Yeah, right.

**Andrew** (01:01:31): What else is that?

**Bryan** (01:01:33): Appliances.

**Andrew** (01:01:35): No, appliance is not a cabinet run.

**Andrew** (01:01:38): It is technically a cabinet type.

**Bryan** (01:01:42): These are cabin types.

**Bryan** (01:01:43): Bases and uppers.

**Andrew** (01:01:44): No, it's a base run.

**Bryan** (01:01:46): Oh, oh.

**Andrew** (01:01:47): And then an upper run.

**Bryan** (01:01:48): Okay.

**Andrew** (01:01:49): And then any full length Things are included as their own run.

**Bryan** (01:01:53): You could probably put trim in there or wall panel.

**Bryan** (01:01:57): Because you could have a wall with no cabinets and trim and no cabinets and wallpaper.

**Bryan** (01:02:02): Okay.

**Andrew** (01:02:02): So paneling it together or separate.

**Andrew** (01:02:09): Cool.

**Bryan** (01:02:10): And we do make doors.

**Bryan** (01:02:11): We could probably doors as a separate.

**Andrew** (01:02:14): Okay.

**Bryan** (01:02:14): Like passage doors.

**Bryan** (01:02:15): Passage doors in particular.

**Bryan** (01:02:16): Okay.

**Andrew** (01:02:17): Which means these guys need their own trim, paneling, and doors need their own sub things.

**Bryan** (01:02:23): Yeah.

**Andrew** (01:02:27): Okay.

**Bryan** (01:02:28): This is an example of something we don't have to.

**Bryan** (01:02:31): To flush out now.

**Bryan** (01:02:32): Like, you can flush.

**Andrew** (01:02:33): Oh, I know that.

**Andrew** (01:02:34): I'm not worrying about this right now.

**Andrew** (01:02:38): Okay, so then at the cabinet level.

**Andrew** (01:02:42): So in cabinet run, what else am I defining?

**Andrew** (01:02:43): I'm not just determining cabinet run type.

**Andrew** (01:02:46): What else do I need to know about cabinet runs?

**Andrew** (01:02:48): If you're grouping a whole set.

**Andrew** (01:02:50): So things that.

**Andrew** (01:02:51): What can you determine this level?

**Bryan** (01:02:52): Can you.

**Andrew** (01:02:53): Do you want to set pricing or do you want to set at the cabinet level?

**Bryan** (01:03:03): I guess you could be done here.

**Bryan** (01:03:04): Yeah.

**Andrew** (01:03:05): Okay.

**Andrew** (01:03:07): Do you want to set measurements of the.

**Andrew** (01:03:10): Do you want to record the measurements of a run?

**Andrew** (01:03:13): Like, how long is it from this end to that end?

**Bryan** (01:03:15): So let's say there's a job that's already drawn.

**Bryan** (01:03:17): It's already defined.

**Andrew** (01:03:19): I get that.

**Andrew** (01:03:20): But it actually needs to be extracted from that definition because those numbers can be used.

**Andrew** (01:03:24): Like, that's the important thing to know here.

**Andrew** (01:03:27): Like, for example, if you start speccing out these cabinets and your math doesn't map it, I need to red flag you.

**Bryan** (01:03:36): Okay.

**Andrew** (01:03:36): Do you get what I'm saying?

**Andrew** (01:03:37): Like, if we start building all these cabinets, it's this link, this link.

**Andrew** (01:03:40): And then it comes back and it's like, hey, that's not what you said for 50.
