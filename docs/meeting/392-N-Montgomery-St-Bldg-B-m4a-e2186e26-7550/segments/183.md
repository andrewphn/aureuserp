## Transcript

**Andrew** (01:57:23): You're okay with me designing it that way?

**Bryan** (01:57:27): I don't want to do that.

**Andrew** (01:57:28): I know you don't.

**Andrew** (01:57:29): But like ideally for the best kind of use case scenario of all the data, that's the way that we're going to have to do it for now.

**Andrew** (01:57:35): Until we find a better way.

**Bryan** (01:57:38): Yeah, I'm certainly okay trying it.

**Andrew** (01:57:40): Okay, cool.

**Andrew** (01:57:42): It will take you a little more time to do, but it'll be well worth it.

**Andrew** (01:57:46): And then we can take out the things that like we never end up requiring.

**Andrew** (01:57:50): But for now it's gonna have too much that you can like take out.

**Andrew** (01:57:55): Okay, cool.

**Andrew** (01:57:57): Shelves.
