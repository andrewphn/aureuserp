## Transcript

**Andrew** (02:36:38): So and then you make the overall cabinet card with the tasks.

**Andrew** (02:36:46): And then from those tasks they can make subtasks.

**Andrew** (02:36:52): Right?

**Andrew** (02:36:52): That's what we want.

**Andrew** (02:36:53): So let's say build cabinet.

**Andrew** (02:36:57): They can farm out a subtask.

**Bryan** (02:36:59): And on that cover sheet I can put all the details, make the crown.

**Bryan** (02:37:03): Don't make the crown, make the countertop.

**Andrew** (02:37:05): Okay, so but basically they can get their task and then inside that task they can create subtasks and assign that subtask in some way.

**Andrew** (02:37:13): Yeah.

**Andrew** (02:37:14): Okay, cool.

**Andrew** (02:37:18): In that subtask, what's in that subtask?

**Andrew** (02:37:22): What's.

**Bryan** (02:37:22): Because they're farming up.

**Andrew** (02:37:23): Yeah, just the notes.

**Andrew** (02:37:26): It's like super basic.

**Andrew** (02:37:27): They need to attach an image to it.

**Bryan** (02:37:29): I think it needs to be tied to.

**Bryan** (02:37:30): To.

**Andrew** (02:37:32): Yeah.

**Bryan** (02:37:32): If you could attach an image, that's fine.

**Bryan** (02:37:34): Like, so I could snap.

**Andrew** (02:37:35): If you're assigned a subtask, does it make the cabinet they're working on, all the files and everything for that cabinet visible to that person.

**Bryan** (02:37:47): Necessary.

**Andrew** (02:37:51): But you don't care if it happens or not?

**Bryan** (02:37:53): No.

**Andrew** (02:37:54): Okay, cool.

**Bryan** (02:37:55): That could be some of that.

**Bryan** (02:37:56): We could just try out and see.

**Bryan** (02:37:57): I don't think it'll be important.

**Andrew** (02:37:58): If I'm assigned to cut a door, then I should be able to access everything about that cabinet.

**Andrew** (02:38:05): I need to understand you're not.

**Bryan** (02:38:06): I think the subtest he's gonna farm out is gonna be mill me 17 pieces of maple at inch three quarter by an inch.

**Bryan** (02:38:15): It has nothing to do with cabinet.

**Bryan** (02:38:17): So he's gonna be farming out things like that.

**Andrew** (02:38:20): Okay, cool.

**Andrew** (02:38:20): So he's gonna be doing down to that granular level.

**Andrew** (02:38:23): Okay.

**Andrew** (02:38:24): How do I get him to be able to do that quickly and easily to make a cut list.

**Bryan** (02:38:30): So one of the things would be like if there was a cut list task template.

**Bryan** (02:38:35): Maybe it may be like a generic task.

**Bryan** (02:38:39): I think it just needs and I don't know, maybe it doesn't.

**Bryan** (02:38:43): I was thinking for progress of the job it would make sense if it was all tiles to what if it gets lost?

**Bryan** (02:38:49): What if a cab doesn't come in?

**Bryan** (02:38:50): How do we know that there's a task out there and what it's assigned to?

**Bryan** (02:38:53): So it just needs like a job assignment and a cabinet relationship.

**Bryan** (02:38:57): This is assigned to 25 friendship and it's cabinet B03.

**Andrew** (02:39:02): No it we do know because the task when he makes it is attached to master task.

**Andrew** (02:39:08): Levi can't sign off on a task is done unless he's ticked the boss.

**Andrew** (02:39:11): That's our task will be okay.

**Andrew** (02:39:13): Yeah.

**Andrew** (02:39:13): So.

**Andrew** (02:39:14): And it can also be tied to like payment structures too.

**Andrew** (02:39:17): So you understand and he understands that he finished his job or he hasn't finished his job.

**Andrew** (02:39:25): Right.
