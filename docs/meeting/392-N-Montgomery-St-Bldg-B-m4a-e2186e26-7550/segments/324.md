Discussion about sourcing

## Transcript

**Andrew** (03:14:45): Hey, a good company that has their business in order wouldn't do that.

**Andrew** (03:14:49): And the best example I use is, I think the Rolling Stones.

**Andrew** (03:14:53): Oh, no.

**Andrew** (03:14:54): Some crazy rock band.

**Andrew** (03:14:55): They always requested blue M&Ms.

**Andrew** (03:14:59): And we always make a joke.

**Andrew** (03:15:01): People always make a joke about that.

**Andrew** (03:15:03): But when they interviewed the person, he said, the blue M and Ms. Are buried 3/4 of the way down in our rider list.

**Andrew** (03:15:11): And if I come into the dressing room and there aren't blue M and Ms.

**Andrew** (03:15:15): There, I can be sure that they didn't pay attention to the rest of the rider, which is like safety things and like stage heights and all those kinds of things.

**Andrew** (03:15:25): So every little thing counts.

**Andrew** (03:15:28): It's just doing it the right way.

**Andrew** (03:15:29): But I know what needs to be done.
