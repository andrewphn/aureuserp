**Andrew** (32:43): We need to build out the job specification card.

**Bryan** (32:47): I think Aiden could be my detailer long term.

**Andrew** (32:50): I think he'd be good at it.

**Andrew** (32:50): Yeah, I do too.

**Bryan** (32:57): So define this job.

**Andrew** (33:01): I can see the breakdown is coming out of the line clearly right now.

**Andrew** (33:09): So the output we're missing is outputting the job card.

**Andrew** (33:12): And bom.

**Bryan** (33:13): This is going to be dagger.

**Andrew** (33:14): Yeah, Job card.

**Andrew** (33:18): And BOM is missing.

**Andrew** (33:20): Not job card.
