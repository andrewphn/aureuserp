**Andrew** (01:57:59): Oh, unless there's anything else on drawers at least.

**Bryan** (01:58:03): No, you're looking at the front of the cabinet.

**Bryan** (01:58:06): You have a door.

**Bryan** (01:58:07): We did all those options.

**Bryan** (01:58:07): You look at the front of the cabinet, we have a drawer.

**Bryan** (01:58:09): We did all those options.

**Andrew** (01:58:11): So what shelving options look like?

**Bryan** (01:58:12): It's like a cabinet internal.

**Andrew** (01:58:14): So how do you want to specify that?

**Andrew** (01:58:17): Whereas is it adjustable?

**Andrew** (01:58:19): Is it.

**Andrew** (01:58:20): Yeah.

**Andrew** (01:58:20): Adjustable or fixed?

**Andrew** (01:58:21): So that's a question.

**Andrew** (01:58:22): Yeah.

**Andrew** (01:58:22): What else is there?

**Bryan** (01:58:23): You could have a pullout.

**Andrew** (01:58:26): So that's still shelf.

**Andrew** (01:58:27): So I wouldn't do pull out and shelf separately.

**Andrew** (01:58:29): I would just go adjustable, fixed or pull out.

**Andrew** (01:58:31): It's just type of shelf.

**Bryan** (01:58:32): I was just on the New York State of Health.

**Andrew** (01:58:35): Yeah, right.

**Andrew** (01:58:38): Do you want to say where it.

**Bryan** (01:58:39): Is in position.

**Andrew** (01:58:42): X, Y and Z and whether the shelf is a U or any of those things?

**Andrew** (01:58:47): You need to tell me those things too.

**Bryan** (01:58:50): I don't think that's necessary.

**Bryan** (01:58:53): I think it would be.
