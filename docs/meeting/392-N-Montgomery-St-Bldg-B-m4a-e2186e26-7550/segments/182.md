**Andrew** (01:54:10): Are you building a drawer to its maximum capacity like you trying to use the best out of the space?

**Bryan** (01:54:16): Oh, no.

**Bryan** (01:54:18): The hardware is specific for the depth because it's an undermount and it hooks on the back.

**Bryan** (01:54:22): It has to be a certain.

**Andrew** (01:54:24): Like imagine we didn't need hardware at all.

**Andrew** (01:54:26): An ideal drawer is just a thing that comes in and out.

**Andrew** (01:54:30): Right.

**Andrew** (01:54:30): Ignore hardware for a second.

**Andrew** (01:54:32): So that's what we're doing.

**Andrew** (01:54:33): But to have a drawer come in and out, we require hardware and hardware has specifications requirements for how much it takes.

**Andrew** (01:54:42): Now the hardware, which is really great, all the block hardware comes with its.

**Andrew** (01:54:46): All the details for it.

**Andrew** (01:54:47): Like the actual, when you go to the site has all this stuff for it.

**Andrew** (01:54:52): Now what would be amazing is to already know what the draw width should be based on the hardware.

**Andrew** (01:55:00): Because you're always trying to maximize like the hardware will sit there.

**Andrew** (01:55:03): You're going to know that the drawer, because of the opening of the internals, you know that drawer is going to be that.

**Andrew** (01:55:09): That's.

**Andrew** (01:55:10): Is that an assumption that is fair to make?

**Bryan** (01:55:13): Yes.

**Andrew** (01:55:14): Is there a scenario when it is not that.

**Andrew** (01:55:19): No.

**Bryan** (01:55:20): I think if you go off that.

**Bryan** (01:55:21): If you go off your opening your cabinet opening, not your face frame opening, your cabinet opening.

**Bryan** (01:55:26): Correct.

**Bryan** (01:55:26): And you'll get it every time.

**Andrew** (01:55:27): Okay.

**Andrew** (01:55:28): So that's something that like if you add a drawer and you select the hardware.

**Andrew** (01:55:34): I can already make an assumption.

**Andrew** (01:55:35): The only thing I don't know is this is just Charles McClure.

**Bryan** (01:55:38): Yeah.

**Andrew** (01:55:39): Am I right?

**Bryan** (01:55:40): Okay, thank you.

**Andrew** (01:55:41): Cool.

**Andrew** (01:55:42): So and.

**Bryan** (01:55:42): And you have to have like, it has to be adjustable because what if it.

**Andrew** (01:55:46): It could take a drawer.

**Andrew** (01:55:48): I'm just.

**Bryan** (01:55:49): But they have a sink there.

**Bryan** (01:55:50): So it has to be a 12 inch people.

**Bryan** (01:55:54): Yeah.

**Bryan** (01:55:54): With depth.

**Andrew** (01:55:55): Yeah.

**Andrew** (01:55:56): So basically you just need an offset field as well.

**Andrew** (01:56:00): That's what it's called.

**Bryan** (01:56:01): Okay.

**Andrew** (01:56:01): So as in like.

**Andrew** (01:56:02): Hey, like this is what the.

**Andrew** (01:56:03): It computes.

**Andrew** (01:56:04): But we want to add an offset of.

**Bryan** (01:56:07): Because drawers you can go deep, they can be a U shaped drawer.

**Bryan** (01:56:10): Cutlery drawer.

**Bryan** (01:56:12): You should shoot around Pl.

**Andrew** (01:56:14): Yeah.

**Bryan** (01:56:14): Yeah.

**Andrew** (01:56:15): Oh really?

**Andrew** (01:56:16): That's pretty cool.

**Andrew** (01:56:17): Like also just I had a question about what else about.

**Bryan** (01:56:27): Don't we do that type.

**Andrew** (01:56:29): And you had.

**Bryan** (01:56:30): But you already did like when Doors and drawers.

**Bryan** (01:56:32): We did that.

**Andrew** (01:56:33): No, we did draw.

**Andrew** (01:56:34): We did doors.

**Bryan** (01:56:35): Okay.

**Andrew** (01:56:35): So yeah, doors.

**Andrew** (01:56:36): Do you want doors to also cover draw door faces?

**Andrew** (01:56:41): Are we just going to count them as the same thing or do you want to count them?

**Andrew** (01:56:46): No, I take that back.

**Andrew** (01:56:48): Each section should have its own face property.

**Andrew** (01:56:50): Okay.

**Andrew** (01:56:51): Yeah, yeah.

**Bryan** (01:56:53): And then when you define it could be flat slab, it could be paneled, it could be custom rail.

**Bryan** (01:56:59): It's rail in style.

**Andrew** (01:57:01): So I need you to understand what I'm saying that's going to happen now is you're going to have a parallel screen that when you add a cabinet to a cabinet run, it's going to ask you how many sections, how many openings are in it.

**Andrew** (01:57:16): Then it's going to ask you all those details and then you're going to do it as you're going.
