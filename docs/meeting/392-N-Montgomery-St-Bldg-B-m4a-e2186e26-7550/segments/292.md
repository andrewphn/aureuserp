Discussion about cabinet

## Transcript

**Andrew** (02:57:15): What I'm saying is I'll take that file and I already on my own should be able to get to the point of like defining all the cabinets and runs and stuff.

**Andrew** (02:57:26): And you can change it later.

**Andrew** (02:57:27): But like I can say there's an upper, there's a lower, there's a base, there's four bases, there's three cabinets.

**Andrew** (02:57:34): Just a move past the text.

**Andrew** (02:57:47): Okay, so just clarifying something linear.

**Andrew** (02:57:49): 3.

**Andrew** (02:57:51): It's just literally from here to here.

**Andrew** (02:57:54): That's it.

**Andrew** (02:57:55): And then if it's a base and if there's something stacked on top of it, then I double it and then if it a full, then it's a double automatically.

**Andrew** (02:58:04): Any other things on simplicity of math there?

**Bryan** (02:58:13): If it's a paneled appliance, we include it.

**Andrew** (02:58:17): Oh, so we count that as file linear fee.

**Andrew** (02:58:19): Mm.

**Andrew** (02:58:20): Okay.

**Bryan** (02:58:22): If it's not panel, we don't.

**Andrew** (02:58:25): Okay, cool.

**Andrew** (02:58:30): That means that if I'm right, an idiot can price out the new feet.

**Andrew** (02:58:38): So you don't have to do that technically.

**Andrew** (02:58:44): Okay, cool.

**Andrew** (02:58:47): All right.

**Andrew** (02:58:51): Yeah, that's it.

**Andrew** (02:58:57): What are you still worried about?

**Andrew** (02:58:59): Like in terms of what else I need to do, this is just very.

**Bryan** (02:59:05): Different from what I expected.

**Bryan** (02:59:06): Like I thought were going to like kind of work through some of the things I thought I was going.

**Andrew** (02:59:09): To get ready for this job.

**Andrew** (02:59:11): Yeah.
