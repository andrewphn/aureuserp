So yeah, so they're going to take the hardware from the wall and put it allocated into one of the job boxes for hardware and then it's done until it needs to get shipped out.

---

## Bryan - 00:16

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

For sheet goods, we're going to keep a livestock of commonly used things, which is really becoming just pre finished plywood.

---

## Bryan - 00:31

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

If we don't have job base, we're going to just label it on the side when it gets received for which job it's for.

---

## Bryan - 00:50

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

I'm going to go out.

---

## Bryan - 00:53

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

I'm first going to go through the hardware and see what we have on.

---

## Andrew - 01:02:46

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

What else do I need to know about cabinet runs?

---

## Andrew - 01:03:27

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

Like, for example, if you start speccing out these cabinets and your math doesn't map it, I need to red flag you.

---

## Andrew - 01:04:46

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

And every detail should be inspect out for them.

---

## Andrew - 01:07:17

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

I need to know what is the specific full spec for a cabinet so that you can.

---

## Andrew - 01:07:33

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

Hey, this cabinet, the face frames of this, the kick is going to be this or the.

---

## Andrew - 01:07:57

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

That's what I need to finalize that.

---

## Bryan - 01:08:30

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

I don't think that it's the task card picture that they'll need, which is okay because I think it's going to generate the.

---

## Andrew - 01:11:24

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

Now what are those fields that you need to get the job done?

---

## Andrew - 01:11:30

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

That's what I need to get from you in right up.

---

## Andrew - 01:11:33

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

What other things that the guys need to know like face frames, how far is the kit?

---

## Andrew - 01:12:53

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

And so the cabinet run will determine its type.

---

## Andrew - 01:15:06

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

No, because middle is going to be the generic.

---

## Bryan - 01:16:32

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

So they need to know, am I making this five piece or am I making this?

---

## Bryan - 01:16:52

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

That should define it all.

---

## Bryan - 01:16:53

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

Because the hinge type will define if it's inset or overlay.

---

## Andrew - 01:16:58

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

You need to tell me that the.

---

## Bryan - 01:17:42

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

That's why it's going to better to practice together.

---

## Bryan - 01:17:51

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

But I will 100% try because I see what the end goal is.

---

## Andrew - 01:18:01

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

It's about the person who is going to fulfill that role.

---

## Andrew - 01:18:08

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

But if your job is to spec out a job, you're filling in the details that are going to come up.

---

## Andrew - 01:18:15

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

Those guys are going to ask.

---

## Andrew - 01:18:19

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

It should already be there for them.

---

## Andrew - 01:19:29

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

This should work.

---

## Andrew - 01:19:56

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

So what, Once we finish doing this, you should get all of the hardware options and then you pick one.

---

## Andrew - 01:20:05

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

Then you should select like, it'll say, here are all the hardware.

---

## Andrew - 01:21:38

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

You should be snapping in there.

---

## Andrew - 01:21:49

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

Once you've written it in Rhino, it should just pull because the door's been labeled correctly.

---

## Andrew - 01:23:04

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

I need to restroom.

---

## Andrew - 01:25

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

Okay, so if they need to order how.

---

## Bryan - 01:25:48

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

When I do a job here and I need to export all the NC file information, I can get every cabinet's worth of pre finish for a job because it's all here.

---

## Andrew - 01:26:39

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

What do you need to.

---

## Bryan - 01:27:39

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

Your styles will match your drawers.

---

## Andrew - 01:29:02

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

And to build a face frame for this base cabinet, what do I need to know?

---

## Bryan - 01:29:10

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

You need to know Your face frame doesn't match your cabinet width.

---

## Andrew - 01:29:51

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

Need to know before I go and.

---

## Andrew - 01:29:57

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

So I need to know.

---

## Bryan - 01:30:03

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

So you need to know what the next cabinet Is.

---

## Andrew - 01:30:18

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

So that's something we need to know.

---

## Andrew - 01:31:03

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

I think you should call.

---

## Andrew - 01:31:07

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

I need to work out how to put door like.

---

## Bryan - 01:34

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

Yeah, I probably should approve it.

---

## Andrew - 01:34:23

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

So I need to make the face frame.

---

## Andrew - 01:34:26

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

I need to know that I'm cutting 41 by 57, 9, 16.

---

## Andrew - 01:34:41

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

And then I need to know individual openings.

---

## Andrew - 01:35:04

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

I don't need to know the data.

---

## Andrew - 01:35:05

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

I just need to know the fields that you would put a number in.

---

## Andrew - 01:35:37

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

But face frame will have what's the overall inside.

---

## Andrew - 01:35:42

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

That's all I need to know from you.

---

## Andrew - 01:35:50

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

I just need to give you the feel so you can type it in.

---

## Bryan - 01:35:57

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

So I don't know if we need to go this route.

---

## Bryan - 01:36:21

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

That information is too confusing to somebody who's going to come and build the thing at the end.

---

## Andrew - 01:36:29

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

You just punched the hole in it is that when you get down to you, are you going to do these sections first before you design the face frame?

---

## Bryan - 01:36:39

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

Am I going to do the section views, not sections.

---

## Andrew - 01:36:43

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

Are you going to do the openings first before you do the face frame?

---

## Andrew - 01:36:47

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

Am I going to do the design out the openings like in this one?

---

## Andrew - 01:36:55

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

Are you going to do the floors, doors, and shelving inside a cabinet before you go and spec out a face frame?

---

## Bryan - 01:38:46

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

No, now I'm going into a room, and if there's casing here, this phase frame is going to be two and three quarter wide instead of an inch and three quarter wide.

---

## Bryan - 01:38:55

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

So these openings are going to get divided into two, and they're 18 and 7, 8 each.

---

## Andrew - 01:41:00

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

What are you going to do?

---

## Bryan - 01:41:01

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

We're going to draw section views.

---

## Bryan - 01:41:49

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

But I need to draw the drawers for a personal job if I'm gonna order them because I need to know that they're gonna fit.

---

## Andrew - 01:42:13

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

Are you not going to give me the.

---

## Bryan - 01:42:31

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

If I need to do plywood parts first, I'll do all that first.

---

## Andrew - 01:43:58

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

But also, what else do I need to know apart from the openings?

---

## Andrew - 01:44:06

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

What does a blind person need to know about new cabinet?

---

## Andrew - 01:44:15

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

So I need to know face frame, what are the other categories?

---

## Andrew - 01:44:50

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

But what I'm saying is, like, you do need to know the face frame, this stuff.

---

## Andrew - 01:44:57

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

You need to know how wide am I cutting the face frame?

---

## Andrew - 01:45:18

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

How do we do it in a way that it is the way that, like, I need to have the feels that you would check with your eyes.

---

## Andrew - 01:45:52

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

You must have.

---

## Andrew - 01:47:31

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

So how would they go about doing this and what would they need to do it?

---

## Bryan - 01:47:37

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

They need to know to make a face frame.

---

## Andrew - 01:47:50

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

So, will, why can't I have this ready to go for them every time?

---

## Andrew - 01:48:18

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

I just need to make sure that we dotted our I's, crossed our T's.

---

## Andrew - 01:49:44

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

I just needed to understand was there any kind of figures that I need to pull out?

---

## Andrew - 01:50:05

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

Let's say we can't see and see, and I'm cutting a door, I need to know about the door.

---

## Bryan - 01:50:10

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

I need to do the same thing.

---

## Bryan - 01:50:11

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

Then I need to have a PDF upload for that cabinet.

---

## Andrew - 01:50:23

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

It reinforces my point that each cabinet really should have its own rhino.

---

## Andrew - 01:51:24

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

What notes, what explanations need to be written down.

---

## Bryan - 01:51:28

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

If we do drawers, we need to know if it's what it's made of.

---

## Bryan - 01:53:12

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

So that won't always work because if you have a face frame cabinet here that goes to a European style cabinet and your drawer face, your opening is going to be different and your drawer is offset and you could have two drawers that land on the same divider so that math will be different.

---

## Andrew - 01:53:27

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

So I don't need to know that the map so much as I need to know the field name that you would use to explain that offset.

---

## Bryan - 01:53:39

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

What I need to know for drawers is the type.

---

## Andrew - 01:54:52

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

Now what would be amazing is to already know what the draw width should be based on the hardware.

---

## Andrew - 01:55:00

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

Because you're always trying to maximize like the hardware will sit there.

---

## Andrew - 01:55:03

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

You're going to know that the drawer, because of the opening of the internals, you know that drawer is going to be that.

---

## Bryan - 01:56:12

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

You should shoot around Pl.

---

## Andrew - 01:56:41

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

Are we just going to count them as the same thing or do you want to count them?

---

## Andrew - 01:56:48

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

Each section should have its own face property.

---

## Andrew - 01:57:01

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

So I need you to understand what I'm saying that's going to happen now is you're going to have a parallel screen that when you add a cabinet to a cabinet run, it's going to ask you how many sections, how many openings are in it.

---

## Andrew - 01:57:16

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

Then it's going to ask you all those details and then you're going to do it as you're going.

---

## Andrew - 01:57:29

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

But like ideally for the best kind of use case scenario of all the data, that's the way that we're going to have to do it for now.

---

## Andrew - 01:57:42

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

It will take you a little more time to do, but it'll be well worth it.

---

## Andrew - 01:58:47

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

You need to tell me those things too.

---

## Bryan - 01:58:55

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

Where it's going to come into play is when I draw a section view and that goes to the CNC for programming.

---

## Andrew - 01:59:16

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

I still think we should have.

---

## Bryan - 02:00:30

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

That will be defined on the PDF of the face frame.

---

## Bryan - 02:00:34

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

Because a face frame will commonly come all the way to the ground and it'll have that defined there.

---

## Bryan - 02:00:43

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

The one I showed you did not come to the ground, but it will.

---

## Bryan - 02:01:36

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

I'm going to pull the dimensions just like I'm doing a door.

---

## Andrew - 02:02:32

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

Do we need to put that information?

---

## Bryan - 02:03:16

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

We don't need to.

---

## Andrew - 02:03:19

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

Because the install will do all that on their own.

---

## Bryan - 02:03:27

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

You don't need to plant.

---

## Andrew - 02:03:28

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

Office is easy except for exhausts and things you need to talk a bit about.

---

## Andrew - 02:04:02

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

Probably cabinet run level because it's going to be consistent.

---

## Bryan - 02:04:28

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

You have hood, which is like a unique one for opers where you would need to specify the mechanicals.

---

## Andrew - 02:05:14

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

Do you need to.

---

## Andrew - 02:06:12

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

And the holes will pop through.

---

## Andrew - 02:07

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

Because we should have them making people pos.

---

## Bryan - 02:07:12

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

That need to get happen.

---

## Andrew - 02:07:12

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

So just so you know, so I'm not having you double work is when you draw annotation in, it's going to grab that section and group it.

---

## Andrew - 02:13:03

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

I shouldn't allow him to take 20 sheets because what if something goes wrong in this other job?

---

## Bryan - 02:15:09

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

Well, Levi doesn't need to know where materials are because he needs to know where cut pieces are from the cnc.

---

## Andrew - 02:15:50

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

You don't need to answer that.

---

## Andrew - 02:17:57

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

So what Brian and I were talking about is like, do you want to just get given a cabinet and handle the cabinet, or do you want to get in the cabinet and then like there are all these things that need to be job down.

---

## Andrew - 02:18:20

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

You want defined previously where it's like, hey, like section one, these are all the tasks that need to be done for that.

---

## Andrew - 02:19:20

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

Yeah, he will have the ability to make tasks, but he's gonna have to make tasks.

---

## Andrew - 02:19:27

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

You mean like I need to do that on the computer or you're gonna do that running is what I'm saying.

---

## Andrew - 02:19:36

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

Like, if I saw all the odds and ends of like, if we're going to buy a room, I'd like to just see it on a card.

---

## Andrew - 02:20:40

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

I started doing oak tops and I know that I'm ahead there, but I just need to wait for Shane to get the files to cut the CNC and then combine the two.

---

## Andrew - 02:20:54

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

If you planned it out, if you spent that half an hour and looked at what it is that you plan to do and then execute the plan rather than do it right.

---

## Andrew - 02:21:19

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

You're going to part out the crown making.

---

## Andrew - 02:24:34

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

I probably should get so and so started on sanding this stuff down.

---

## Bryan - 02:25:15

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

Yeah, because that's going to be too much.

---

## Bryan - 02:25:16

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

It's going to be.

---

## Bryan - 02:25:18

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

The idea is good, the execution should be simpler.

---

## Andrew - 02:25:22

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

Yeah, don't worry about how long it's going to take.

---

## Andrew - 02:26:03

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

So by the time you're done here, the building, the tasks, you should just tie to that.

---

## Andrew - 02:26:11

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

Item, that's how I can like let me show you tasks right now because you need to see what it looks like so you get what I'm talking about.

---

## Andrew - 02:26:54

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

This will be easier later, but I can assign it all the way down.

---

## Andrew - 02:27:42

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

But I'm saying that if I'm working on something, I Will probably make a way to bulk make tasks with all the same data.

---

## Andrew - 02:28:08

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

So I'm going to select the cabinet and then I'm going to say, doors need sanding.

---

## Andrew - 02:28:17

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

And then everyone will just have a task list just show up.

---

## Andrew - 02:29:11

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

That's why I'm saying I need to know that this will get used.

---

## Andrew - 02:29:17

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

What do I need to change about it to make it get used?

---

## Bryan - 02:29:39

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

I think they should have a baseline.

---

## Andrew - 02:30:55

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

I need to add project milestones.

---

## Andrew - 02:31:37

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

It will move its phase.

---

## Bryan - 02:32:25

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

I think we should not have task level job cards.

---

## Bryan - 02:32:27

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

Then we should just have cabinet level job cards and then you can farm out your tasks that you're saying, right?

---

## Andrew - 02:32:32

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

So if you're making cabinet level job cards, then in that cabinet level job card you have, you need to make tasks in there.

---

## Bryan - 02:35:21

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

So that should be the file that's on there.

---

## Andrew - 02:35:46

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

So you should be triggering sourcing per prior to starting work on this.

---

## Bryan - 02:35:52

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

Design and sourcing are going to kind of happen around the same time.

---

## Andrew - 02:37:27

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

They need to attach an image to it.

---

## Andrew - 02:37:58

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

If I'm assigned to cut a door, then I should be able to access everything about that cabinet.

---

## Andrew - 02:38:05

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

I need to understand you're not.

---

## Andrew - 02:39:11

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

That's our task will be okay.

---

## Andrew - 02:39:36

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

No, but the actual workflow of taking this, like I need to make a place where all the CNC stuff is saved.

---

## Andrew - 02:39:55

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

I'm just saying in my mind all that notion stuff I need to transfer into our main database, that's a whole other thing.

---

## Andrew - 02:40:29

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

I should just give you the bare bones of like making a new project.

---

## Bryan - 02:41:34

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

Aiden is going to do the inventory.

---

## Bryan - 02:42:08

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

A week and she can do something, well, she won't need to do payroll.

---

## Andrew - 02:42:17

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

Which means we need to start to build out our vendor lists.

---

## Andrew - 02:42:46

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

This is what you need to know about this place.

---

## Andrew - 02:43:03

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

So she's going to do purchasing.

---

## Andrew - 02:43:18

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

Aiden's going to be on the floor and reporting To Sadie.

---

## Andrew - 02:43:54

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

And Sadie should have a weekly meeting with you that reports.

---

## Andrew - 02:44:16

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

I think we should just try just being a height.

---

## Andrew - 02:44:54

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

That's going to work just fine for you, right?

---

## Bryan - 02:47:07

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

I think we need to do it and I'm sure not wrong.

---

## Bryan - 02:47:15

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

Lax pressure lacks pressure is where it's going to happen in order to figure out how to get right.

---

## Bryan - 02:48:39

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

So I think that's why it's like we need enough of it ready that will.

---

## Andrew - 02:49

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

If you don't need to order it, you still need to update current inventory.

**Priority:** medium

It shouldn't fall on me.

---

## Andrew - 02:50:29

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

I am working on the product that will make this work.

---

## Andrew - 02:50:36

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

For each of these steps, we actually need to document a process.

---

## Andrew - 02:50:53

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

But you know what I mean, like, even if I build all this software out and I built it as intuitively as possible, the willpower to do it is something that I'm gonna need help with.

---

## Andrew - 02:51:18

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

So I need to work on the TCS Bible.

---

## Andrew - 02:52:01

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

Will you approve it?

---

## Andrew - 02:53:05

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

But I do need to know what is a pass fail for a complete document.

---

## Andrew - 02:53:12

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

I do need to know what is a pass fail for a dwg.

---

## Andrew - 02:53:16

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

I need to know what a pass fail is for an adequate.

---

## Andrew - 02:53:20

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

I need to know that there's correct tools.

---

## Andrew - 02:54:13

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

No, I'm just saying we need to document and we need to write down, like, you know, how businesses like KFC, McDonald's survive and have thrived.

---

## Andrew - 02:54:56

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

Because there will be a day that you can't write the proposal and I'll have to do it or I am doing it now or like how I do it or if we have a salesperson come in and you can't be here.

---

## Andrew - 02:55:52

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

And there could be a time when someone's purchasing something or someone's deciding if we need or don't need something and they have no reference and they're going to make that mistake and it's going to cost money, it's going to cost time and it's already happened so many times and that's from lack of having a unified resource.

---

## Andrew - 02:56:29

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

So you and I are going to sit and spec out project and get it through these two phases together.

---

## Andrew - 02:56:36

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

And then we're going to get the output is the job card from here.

---

## Andrew - 02:57:15

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

What I'm saying is I'll take that file and I already on my own should be able to get to the point of like defining all the cabinets and runs and stuff.

---

## Andrew - 02:58:59

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

Like in terms of what else I need to do, this is just very.

---

## Bryan - 02:59:06

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

Like I thought were going to like kind of work through some of the things I thought I was going.

---

## Andrew - 02:59:15

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

I mean, what are we going to do?

---

## Bryan - 02:59:29

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

I made a list of like tasks that I'm going to do with her.

---

## Andrew - 03:00:22

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

You were going to demonstrate it.

---

## Andrew - 03:00:24

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

And then when was she going to try and do it.

---

## Andrew - 03:00:34

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

That's how she's going to look.

---

## Andrew - 03:00:37

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

So while that process is happening, she should keep a voice note.

---

## Andrew - 03:01:28

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

She has to be able to articulate like her schedule of learning should be.

---

## Andrew - 03:02:06

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

Your task cards need to be simple.

---

## Andrew - 03:02:59

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

Or one of the team will ask you to do a specific task.

---

## Andrew - 03:03:04

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

But in your first few days, I'm going to teach you a few fundamentals and a few basic tasks that really happen all the time.

---

## Andrew - 03:03:36

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

And this is how you will.

---

## Bryan - 03:03:44

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

That's, that's an expectation that's going to fall flat.

---

## Andrew - 03:04:04

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

A, you know, we're a small business, it's going to be versatile but you'll either get specific tasks that's already been assigned, that's pre allocated to a project and this is the proper way.

---

## Andrew - 03:04:14

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

But they're like any small business you're going to have to be on hand and ready to go with whatever and they will make sure to explain to you what that is and eventually just the subtask, you'll get a subtask list.

---

## Andrew - 03:04:46

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

Something I would train her is in like how you should do this during your training process is you must explain how to check like what is good, what is bad.

---

## Andrew - 03:06:05

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

That will take her an afternoon to do.

---

## Bryan - 03:07:09

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

She's going to do 8 to 4:30.

---

## Andrew - 03:07:22

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

And I'm going to walk her through this.

---

## Andrew - 03:07:25

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

And I'm going to walk us through this and I'm gonna walk her through all of this stuff and then you can do whatever from 8 to 10 and then like after.

---

## Bryan - 03:08:22

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

Aiden, at some point, part of what he was going to do, was he going to be involved with detailing?

---

## Andrew - 03:09:40

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

I need to go check with him to detail out all the specs.

---

## Bryan - 03:09:49

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

What is Sadie going to do starting not next week or the week after?

---

## Andrew - 03:09:52

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

Sadie is going to.

---

## Bryan - 03:10:08

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

I really should do it with this with her.

---

## Andrew - 03:10:10

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

I should do it with.

---

## Andrew - 03:10:11

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

You need to.

---

## Andrew - 03:10:17

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

So that's going to take up her entire time.

---

## Bryan - 03:10:52

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

I'm going to start order on Monday.

---

## Bryan - 03:11:00

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

We will not get past the time crunch.

---

## Bryan - 03:11:28

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

She will be really good too, at.

---

## Andrew - 03:13:36

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

It just needs to be what is going to be 100.

---

## Andrew - 03:14:18

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

Just making that notion like there are other people from, for example, from a marketing point of view, it's going to affect a customer's opinion of us.

---

## Bryan - 03:15:45

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

Yeah, I think trying to get Alina up to speed, which will take more off their plate, off my plate.

---

## Bryan - 03:16:00

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

What sat role will be, if it's even needed.

---

## Bryan - 03:18:03

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

The tide I feel like I'm going to constantly fight against is I don't need it to be as defined and as complicated as a professional business in this world.

---

## Andrew - 03:19:33

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

Yeah, but like, that's what I'm saying to you like now that you understand that there's all these things that need to be organized, you wouldn't.

---

## Andrew - 04:27

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

So I think that bill of materials will be our checklist as well.

---

## Bryan - 05:48

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

I'm going to give you two.

---

## Bryan - 06:00

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

No, it would be the outside because it's going to go.

---

## Bryan - 08:30

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

Probably doesn't need to be.

---

## Andrew - 08:31

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

Need to be 24.

---

## Bryan - 08:36

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

It's going to be flush with that.

---

## Bryan - 09:21

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

So to leave sourcing at the bottom of the page of the BOM will be a.

---

## Andrew - 09:33

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

I think they should just get a fresh bomb.

---

## Bryan - 09:37

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

They should just get at the end.

---

## Andrew - 09:46

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

They just need to know where to go to get the things they need.

---

## Andrew - 10:22

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

So we need to produce a finalized bomb, basically.

---

## Andrew - 12:10

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

Like, what does production need to complete this job?

---

## Andrew - 13:33

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

So we just need to make sure that we have a printed drawing.

---

## Bryan - 14:03

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

We're not going to print a file that is 26 pages of 36 x 24s at this juncture.

---

## Andrew - 15:08

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

So we need to export from Rhino.

---

## Andrew - 16:15

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

It should be all details except financial.

---

## Andrew - 16:18

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

Basically, like from the floor, I should be able to.

---

## Andrew - 16:26

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

If I'm Levi, I should be able to walk straight back to the inventory person and not talk to you and go, hey, dude, you said all these things.

---

## Andrew - 20:08

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

We shouldn't be having change orders at this phase.

---

## Andrew - 20:24

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

I just need to say it out loud.

---

## Andrew - 23:21

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

So, like, if they know that today we're starting a new job, they've already done the count and confirmed it for Levi before Levi has to do it, because they should have done that before knowing that it's coming.

---

## Andrew - 23:46

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

So Levi shouldn't have to Go pick his sheets.

---

## Andrew - 23:48

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

Or he should already have a preset marker of hey, this is your bet.

---

## Andrew - 24:07

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

So which means that they should be prepping for the CNC person too.

---

## Andrew - 24:36

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

How many pieces they should have at the end.

---

## Andrew - 25:00

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

And then we need to make sure he has the supplies too.

---

## Bryan - 25:06

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

I think we should take on as.

---

## Bryan - 25:49

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

Leave successfully, we need to track each part that goes into the trailer.

---

## Bryan - 25:56

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

And then we need to make a bol.

---

## Andrew - 26:47

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

So there are delivery tasks that need to be made.

---

## Bryan - 30:11

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

I'm going to get inspiration, picks, drawings, dimensions, whatever at that juncture or I'm going to go to the field and get them.

---

## Andrew - 30:57

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

They should be put in the folder structure.

---

## Andrew - 31:04

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

So when I text them to you should be putting them in the project folder.

---

## Andrew - 31:17

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

Okay, so they need to go in the folders.

---

## Bryan - 31:26

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

So it's going to come to the question.

---

## Andrew - 31:51

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

We're not outputting that right now, so we need to do that.

---

## Andrew - 32:43

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

We need to build out the job specification card.

---

## Bryan - 33:13

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

This is going to be dagger.

---

## Andrew - 35:23

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

Yeah, Sadie will make purchase orders.

---

## Andrew - 35:25

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

Yeah, Sadie will make.

---

## Andrew - 36:44

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

He's one of those people who Will prep them for their project.

---

## Andrew - 36:56

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

He's going to be the point of call where someone's going to go like, hey, do you know where the sheets are for this new project I'm starting?

---

## Andrew - 38:15

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

One is Aiden will alec check if the resources we.

---

## Andrew - 39:19

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

Sadie's not going to go count it.

---

## Andrew - 39:22

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

Aiden's going to warehouse manage that.

---

## Bryan - 42:07

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

So yeah, so the sheets will come in one way or another.

---

## Bryan - 42:15

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

Aiden will learn that eventually.

---

## Andrew - 43:46

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

I think initially when he's starting, he's going to be more full than you think.

---

## Andrew - 44:15

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

But now it's going to sit with you and go like, hey, how.

---

## Andrew - 44:27

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

It's going to be full time.

---

## Bryan - 45:57

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

And the reason I'm saying that is because Dagger who's been the operator, I'm not going to get give him the making of the NC file.

---

## Andrew - 46:07

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

So Dagger when he finishes drawing should load onto so on the stick should have two folders.

---

## Andrew - 46:15

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

It should have completed and not completed like to be done or in production.

---

## Andrew - 46:21

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

And in pre production you should have a pre production folder and a production folder because that production folder should be ready to go.

---

## Bryan - 46:51

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

He will be able to work on right now his gaps are when the machine's running.

---

## Andrew - 47:19

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

Like, like generally I'm just saying like it's just going to be chaos and chaotic environment, chaotic product.

---

## Andrew - 47:27

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

Just letting you know heads up right now that's going to happen even though we're not considering.

---

## Andrew - 47:32

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

So if he's doing that we need to know what's been drawn and what's not been drawn and what's coming in the next week.

---

## Andrew - 48:00

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

We now need to talk globally because that's a global task.

---

## Andrew - 48:11

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

Because there may be multiple projects and multiple DWGs that need to be drawn.

---

## Andrew - 48:22

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

Technically, the drawer should just log in and not know anything about anything he needs to draw.

---

## Andrew - 48:36

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

We need to equip that person to be a robot.

---

## Andrew - 49:31

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

I am going to work on improving a few things, but it has for your eyes some basic information about it.

---

## Andrew - 49:40

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

There are project alerts if things come up and I'm going to explain a couple things to you in a second.

---

## Andrew - 50:16

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

Now here's where I'm going to like ask things.

---

## Andrew - 50:30

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

What do we need to know about a room that I'm missing?

---

## Bryan - 50:38

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

We need to know everything we're going to manufacture.

---

## Andrew - 50:48

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

Is there a global room information that you generally need to know?

---

## Andrew - 52:08

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

What do we need to know about that kitchen?

---

## Andrew - 52:10

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

Are there any customer related things or things that we need to know?

---

## Andrew - 52:39

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

Because if you can't get into the room, like what do I need to know?

---

## Andrew - 53:25

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

Like what area of the room and is it going to occupy?

---

## Andrew - 53:30

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

So that includes things like things I need to know about room locations.

---

## Andrew - 53:43

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

What do I need to consider about a project based on just.

---

## Andrew - 53:50

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

What do you need to know?

---

## Andrew - 54:41

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

They're both going to be options.

---

## Bryan - 55:20

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

It probably should be a text field.

---

## Bryan - 55:32

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

No, we should not do that.

---

## Bryan - 55:33

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

Because if you look at a wall and you're coming off the right side or left side, it's going to be completely different.

---

## Andrew - 57:24

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

That will come down.

---

## Andrew - 57:39

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

What I mean is if you go to a room location and you say, these are all Level 1 cabinets, the pricing will move down.

---

## Andrew - 57:48

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

So, like, everything in there is going to be this material.

---

## Andrew - 57:51

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

It's going to be this thing, this hardware, this thing.

---

## Andrew - 58:42

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

Then you should just be able to go to the cabinet run and change it.

---

## Andrew - 59:01

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium

So at the cabinet run level, tell me what specifications I need to include so you can fill it in.

---
