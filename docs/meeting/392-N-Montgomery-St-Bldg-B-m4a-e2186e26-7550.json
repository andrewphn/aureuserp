what you're holding is a task job card or a cabinet level job card.","startTime":"14:53","endTime":"15:00","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But the job card is that front page only.","startTime":"15:00","endTime":"15:04","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"The rest of it is what's behind it.","startTime":"15:05","endTime":"15:07","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So he needs all that stuff.","startTime":"15:07","endTime":"15:08","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So we need to export from Rhino.","startTime":"15:08","endTime":"15:11","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Those are the pages at design.","startTime":"15:13","endTime":"15:15","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So then you have to make the job cards at design because they're extremely

that.","startTime":"15:23","endTime":"15:25","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"This needs a job

that.","startTime":"15:27","endTime":"15:28","speaker_name":"Bryan","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So I put that in design then.","startTime":"15:28","endTime":"15:30","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So that is what.","startTime":"15:30","endTime":"15:31","speaker_name":"Bryan","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Actually no, I would put at the start of production because it is a separate

apart.","startTime":"15:39","endTime":"15:41","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I just need someone to go back and review the

it's.","startTime":"15:48","endTime":"15:51","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Oh, no, it is making jobs.","startTime":"15:51","endTime":"15:52","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"15:52","endTime":"15:53","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Correct.","startTime":"15:53","endTime":"15:53","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah, 100%.","startTime":"15:53","endTime":"15:54","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So make job cards.","startTime":"15:54","endTime":"15:55","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I wouldn't call it a job card make.","startTime":"16:00","endTime":"16:02","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It is a job card, but it's a bundle, which is all of that stuff.","startTime":"16:04","endTime":"16:08","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"There needs to be a bundle that can just be handed over and it has everything you need in there.","startTime":"16:10","endTime":"16:14","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It should be all details except financial.","startTime":"16:15","endTime":"16:17","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Basically, like from the floor, I should be able to.","startTime":"16:18","endTime":"16:24","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Let's say that we missed a step along the way.","startTime":"16:24","endTime":"16:26","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"If I'm Levi, I should be able to walk straight back to the inventory person and not talk to you and go,

things.","startTime":"16:35","endTime":"16:36","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I don't see them on the

right.","startTime":"16:38","endTime":"16:40","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Like you have to empower them to do without coming back to you.","startTime":"16:40","endTime":"16:43","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So what is everything that we know to give to the guys on the floor to build the thing?","startTime":"16:43","endTime":"16:49","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"What am I missing?","startTime":"16:49","endTime":"16:50","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Is that everything?","startTime":"16:50","endTime":"16:50","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"16:53","endTime":"16:54","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Okay, so how do we make job cards?","startTime":"16:54","endTime":"16:56","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Let's go to job cards.","startTime":"16:56","endTime":"16:57","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So make tasks.","startTime":"16:57","endTime":"16:58","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Break down that process.","startTime":"16:58","endTime":"16:59","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"How do you want to break them down?","startTime":"17:00","endTime":"17:01","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So it's directly related to labeling.","startTime":"17:02","endTime":"17:06","speaker_name":"Bryan","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So you Label a cabinet, desk 01.","startTime":"17:06","endTime":"17:09","speaker_name":"Bryan","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"The tasks for this is build your.","startTime":"17:10","endTime":"17:15","speaker_name":"Bryan","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"It's build a desk, build a top.","startTime":"17:15","endTime":"17:16","speaker_name":"Bryan","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But you have multiple things within

ahead.","startTime":"17:20","endTime":"17:21","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So the problem we're having right now is I'll write all that out, put on a job card, and it's just saved now somewhere on the Internet.","startTime":"17:25","endTime":"17:32","speaker_name":"Bryan","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"The PDFs are not saved with it because they're just snapshots.","startTime":"17:34","endTime":"17:37","speaker_name":"Bryan","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Correct.","startTime":"17:37","endTime":"17:37","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And

that's why I have been doing it in this stage.","startTime":"17:46","endTime":"17:49","speaker_name":"Bryan","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I know I'm just.","startTime":"17:49","endTime":"17:50","speaker_name":"Bryan","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I'm doing a lot here because I'm doing all of

detailer to me is the person who does it.","startTime":"17:54","endTime":"17:57","speaker_name":"Bryan","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So let's continue.","startTime":"17:59","endTime":"18:00","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Let's say that we have.","startTime":"18:00","endTime":"18:01","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We've made all the job

it's.","startTime":"18:44","endTime":"18:45","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"The best way to do it is go, here's the cabinet run, and here is the series of cabinets that you're

else?","startTime":"22:22","endTime":"22:24","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"After a job is done here, the.","startTime":"22:24","endTime":"22:28","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Big things are qc, tracking all the parts, loading it.","startTime":"22:28","endTime":"22:31","speaker_name":"Bryan","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Okay.","startTime":"22:32","endTime":"22:33","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And then.","startTime":"22:33","endTime":"22:33","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Okay, so to go out of production, what do we have to have a QC

that?","startTime":"22:53","endTime":"22:56","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Because warehouse management QC

right.","startTime":"22:58","endTime":"22:59","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Just put another line and just go

coming.","startTime":"23:21","endTime":"23:32","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so we don't have a block in the

is.","startTime":"23:40","endTime":"23:41","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Is loading for each of the stages and loading out.","startTime":"23:41","endTime":"23:45","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So Levi shouldn't have to Go pick his sheets.","startTime":"23:46","endTime":"23:48","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Or he should already have a preset marker of hey, this is your bet.","startTime":"23:48","endTime":"23:53","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"This is the sheets for you.","startTime":"23:53","endTime":"23:54","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And put a piece of paper in there.","startTime":"23:54","endTime":"23:56","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Those top three are yours or it's already moved to a zone.","startTime":"23:56","endTime":"24:00","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Maybe that because it won't work for pre finished and they don't pick sheets.","startTime":"24:00","endTime":"24:05","speaker_name":"Bryan","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"It gets cut in the cnc.","startTime":"24:05","endTime":"24:06","speaker_name":"Bryan","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Correct.","startTime":"24:06","endTime":"24:07","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So which means that they should be prepping for the CNC person too.","startTime":"24:07","endTime":"24:11","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"The CNC person just has to read the label and go.","startTime":"24:11","endTime":"24:14","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"This is the file

sorting.","startTime":"24:19","endTime":"24:20","speaker_name":"Bryan","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"The real world problem we have right now is lots of parts coming out from doing.","startTime":"24:21","endTime":"24:24","speaker_name":"Bryan","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"We missed CNC cut list.","startTime":"24:24","endTime":"24:26","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It's right here.","startTime":"24:26","endTime":"24:27","speaker_name":"Bryan","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"That's just the files to

thing.","startTime":"24:30","endTime":"24:31","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It's not because the cut list has details about the job.","startTime":"24:32","endTime":"24:36","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"How many pieces they should have at the end.","startTime":"24:36","endTime":"24:38","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"How many?","startTime":"24:38","endTime":"24:39","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Like the same thing.","startTime":"24:39","endTime":"24:40","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It's like the job summary of the NC files with it has a picture of the sheet and everything.","startTime":"24:40","endTime":"24:44","speaker_name":"Bryan","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Oh, labeling.","startTime":"24:44","endTime":"24:44","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Okay,

yeah.","startTime":"57:05","endTime":"57:06","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"However you want

the next one is cabinet runs.","startTime":"57:16","endTime":"57:19","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So how.","startTime":"57:19","endTime":"57:19","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"What information is cabinet run level?","startTime":"57:20","endTime":"57:23","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"That will come down.","startTime":"57:24","endTime":"57:25","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So.","startTime":"57:26","endTime":"57:27","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And I'll explain it to you from a pricing point of view.","startTime":"57:27","endTime":"57:29","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So that makes sense as well.","startTime":"57:29","endTime":"57:30","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So when you are pricing, do you want to look at a room location?","startTime":"57:30","endTime":"57:36","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Like, so I built the pricing structure.","startTime":"57:36","endTime":"57:38","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So it's hierarchical.","startTime":"57:38","endTime":"57:39","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"What I mean is if you go to a room location and you say, these are all Level 1 cabinets, the pricing will move down.","startTime":"57:39","endTime":"57:47","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So, like, everything in there is going to be this material.","startTime":"57:48","endTime":"57:50","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It's going to be this thing, this hardware, this thing.","startTime":"57:51","endTime":"57:55","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So do you.","startTime":"57:55","endTime":"57:56","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"You are able to determine what the products are at a global level.","startTime":"57:56","endTime":"58:02","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"You can determine the type.","startTime":"58:02","endTime":"58:03","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And then when you get down to the cabinet, you're like, I need three door

type.","startTime":"58:07","endTime":"58:11","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Now do you want to Determine that at the.","startTime":"58:11","endTime":"58:13","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But with overrides in the specific levels.","startTime":"58:15","endTime":"58:18","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So let's say that you determine all of this to be this particular Blum hardware.","startTime":"58:18","endTime":"58:21","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But when you get down to that special one in the corner and you change the hardware, it only changes at that level.","startTime":"58:21","endTime":"58:27","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So it has hierarchical.","startTime":"58:27","endTime":"58:29","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Does that kind of make sense?","startTime":"58:31","endTime":"58:32","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So you can go in.","startTime":"58:32","endTime":"58:33","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Because I'm just trying to think of you.","startTime":"58:34","endTime":"58:35","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Let's say that they've decided they want to change all the hardware for this base cabinet run.","startTime":"58:35","endTime":"58:41","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Then you should just be able to go to the cabinet run and change it.","startTime":"58:42","endTime":"58:45","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And it changes for all the cabinets.","startTime":"58:45","endTime":"58:47","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Does that kind of make sense?","startTime":"58:48","endTime":"58:49","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Or like, oh, we're changing the color of just this one cabinet in the corner.","startTime":"58:49","endTime":"58:54","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"They want to paint a different color.","startTime":"58:54","endTime":"58:55","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Then you go down to the cabinet and you can change that.","startTime":"58:55","endTime":"58:58","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So there's a specification hierarchy kind of thing.","startTime":"58:58","endTime":"59:01","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So at the cabinet run level, tell me what specifications I need to include so you can fill it in.","startTime":"59:01","endTime":"59:10","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So that includes.","startTime":"59:13","endTime":"59:14","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So let's go through that together.","startTime":"59:14","endTime":"59:15","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Can you grab something to write on.","startTime":"59:15","endTime":"59:16","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"A number of magnets?","startTime":"59:16","endTime":"59:17","speaker_name":"Bryan","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Use Sankity in front of you or use friendship lane, or use one of them in front of you so that we can do this.","startTime":"59:19","endTime":"59:24","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Now you won't do linear feeds at the cabinet run level.","startTime":"59:30","endTime":"59:34","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"You'll do it at the cabinet level, and then it'll escalate up to the cabinet run.","startTime":"59:34","endTime":"59:38","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Actually draw this.","startTime":"59:46","endTime":"59:47","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"59:47","endTime":"59:47","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Okay, so we have project.","startTime":"59:47","endTime":"59:52","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We have room.","startTime":"59:53","endTime":"59:56","speaker_name":"Bryan","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Then we have room location, we have cabinet run.","startTime":"59:59","endTime":"01:00:09","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Then we have cabinet, and then we have.","startTime":"01:00:10","endTime":"01:00:14","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Which is.","startTime":"01:00:14","endTime":"01:00:15","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Haven't done yet, but like sub cabin.","startTime":"01:00:16","endTime":"01:00:21","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And that's like doors and so on and so forth.","startTime":"01:00:23","endTime":"01:00:26","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Okay, so at the project level, we have customer

the room level, we have access.","startTime":"01:00:34","endTime":"01:00:35","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We have.","startTime":"01:00:37","endTime":"01:00:37","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"What do we agree to

then at the cabinet run level, that's where dividing tops and bottoms and tall.","startTime":"01:01:01","endTime":"01:01:07","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Okay.","startTime":"01:01:08","endTime":"01:01:08","speaker_name":"Bryan","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"01:01:09","endTime":"01:01:09","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"What am I defining here?","startTime":"01:01:09","endTime":"01:01:11","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So I feel like cabinet run level has floor to ceiling, like for.","startTime":"01:01:11","endTime":"01:01:16","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"For like tall, explicitly.","startTime":"01:01:16","endTime":"01:01:18","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So what.","startTime":"01:01:18","endTime":"01:01:19","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"What types am I

ceiling.","startTime":"01:01:27","endTime":"01:01:27","speaker_name":"Bryan","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So we just call it full because that could be a closet.","startTime":"01:01:27","endTime":"01:01:31","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah, right.","startTime":"01:01:31","endTime":"01:01:31","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"What else is that?","startTime":"01:01:31","endTime":"01:01:32","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Appliances.","startTime":"01:01:33","endTime":"01:01:34","speaker_name":"Bryan","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"No,

then any full length Things are included as their own run.","startTime":"01:01:49","endTime":"01:01:52","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"You could probably put trim in there or wall panel.","startTime":"01:01:53","endTime":"01:01:55","speaker_name":"Bryan","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Because you could have a wall with no cabinets and trim and no cabinets and

we do make doors.","startTime":"01:02:10","endTime":"01:02:11","speaker_name":"Bryan","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"We could probably doors as a

level.","startTime":"01:02:38","endTime":"01:02:40","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So in cabinet run, what else am I defining?","startTime":"01:02:42","endTime":"01:02:43","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I'm not just determining cabinet run

cool.","startTime":"01:04:22","endTime":"01:04:23","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So this is a

run.","startTime":"01:04:25","endTime":"01:04:27","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So the thing is, the reason I kept run in there and didn't just do cabinets is for a pricing and

uppers.","startTime":"01:04:41","endTime":"01:04:43","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And then walk away.","startTime":"01:04:44","endTime":"01:04:45","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And every detail should be inspect out for

this.","startTime":"01:04:59","endTime":"01:05:00","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"You're doing this.","startTime":"01:05:00","endTime":"01:05:00","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It gives you the option without that grouping, we can't do it.","startTime":"01:05:00","endTime":"01:05:03","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Now, looking at that, at the cabinet run level, what details can you give or you want to

K1.","startTime":"01:05:16","endTime":"01:05:17","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It's kitchen, sink,

the next spec is.","startTime":"01:05:21","endTime":"01:05:22","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I see two sets of things.","startTime":"01:05:22","endTime":"01:05:25","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"You mean like uppers and

lowers.","startTime":"01:05:27","endTime":"01:05:28","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Okay, so.","startTime":"01:05:28","endTime":"01:05:29","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And even though this is just shells, you could call it uppers.","startTime":"01:05:29","endTime":"01:05:32","speaker_name":"Bryan","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah, it's an upper.","startTime":"01:05:32","endTime":"01:05:33","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"01:05:33","endTime":"01:05:33","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So this is upper one.","startTime":"01:05:33","endTime":"01:05:34","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Okay.","startTime":"01:05:35","endTime":"01:05:36","speaker_name":"Bryan","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"01:05:36","endTime":"01:05:36","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Because they are built

inside, upper cabinet run is upper one and upper two.","startTime":"01:05:38","endTime":"01:05:42","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And then down here we have base.","startTime":"01:05:42","endTime":"01:05:45","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"You have one run of lowers.","startTime":"01:05:45","endTime":"01:05:47","speaker_name":"Bryan","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"01:05:47","endTime":"01:05:47","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Two base cabinets and an appliance.","startTime":"01:05:48","endTime":"01:05:50","speaker_name":"Bryan","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Okay, so where's the two base

then how do you want to do defining cabinets?","startTime":"01:05:55","endTime":"01:05:59","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So in my annotation, you've seen the way that I've got it.","startTime":"01:06:02","endTime":"01:06:04","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Basically what I'm gonna have you do is you get to draw K1.","startTime":"01:06:04","endTime":"01:06:08","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Like this is K1.","startTime":"01:06:09","endTime":"01:06:11","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And then I've got it disabled right now.","startTime":"01:06:11","endTime":"01:06:13","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But when you double click on it just isolates that box and you can draw another box inside.","startTime":"01:06:13","endTime":"01:06:18","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And you're only doing it from plan view.","startTime":"01:06:18","endTime":"01:06:20","speaker_name":"Bryan","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"No, you can do this from any.","startTime":"01:06:20","endTime":"01:06:22","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"View page three and it can be on different

I built you a tree that has.","startTime":"01:06:27","endTime":"01:06:30","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"That unifies everything together.","startTime":"01:06:30","endTime":"01:06:32","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So you can draw the plan view, the front view, and then later on, when you finish doing this part, you can pull a page report for that cabinet and it gives you the plan, it gives you the elevation for it, and it gives you all the specs that you did.","startTime":"01:06:32","endTime":"01:06:44","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"You can pull a cabinet run report, and it gives you the entire cabinet run report.","startTime":"01:06:44","endTime":"01:06:48","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But the idea of why this is taking so long is to make sure that I built this universal structure and that I can have it do whatever you need it to do.","startTime":"01:06:49","endTime":"01:06:56","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But what it can't do is what it doesn't have.","startTime":"01:06:56","endTime":"01:06:59","speaker_name":"Bryan","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"It can't pull the face frame dimensions.","startTime":"01:06:59","endTime":"01:07:02","speaker_name":"Bryan","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"It can if you write them in.","startTime":"01:07:02","endTime":"01:07:04","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I can't write them in this PDF in a clean way.","startTime":"01:07:04","endTime":"01:07:10","speaker_name":"Bryan","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"It's so much cleaner to do it just through Rhino and do a separate page.","startTime":"01:07:10","endTime":"01:07:14","speaker_name":"Bryan","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So that's what I'm saying.","startTime":"01:07:14","endTime":"01:07:15","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I am going.","startTime":"01:07:16","endTime":"01:07:16","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I'm building.","startTime":"01:07:17","endTime":"01:07:17","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I need to know what is the specific full spec for a cabinet so that you

Populated.","startTime":"01:07:24","endTime":"01:07:25","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I can find a way to auto populate from Rhino later if need be.","startTime":"01:07:25","endTime":"01:07:29","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But that's a bonus thing.","startTime":"01:07:29","endTime":"01:07:30","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But there needs to be a manual place that's written down.","startTime":"01:07:30","endTime":"01:07:33","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Hey, this cabinet, the face frames of this, the kick is going to be this or the.","startTime":"01:07:33","endTime":"01:07:37","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"This has a kick.","startTime":"01:07:37","endTime":"01:07:38","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It doesn't have a kick.","startTime":"01:07:38","endTime":"01:07:39","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Like all of those things we are about to get to.","startTime":"01:07:39","endTime":"01:07:41","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And you have to give me.","startTime":"01:07:41","endTime":"01:07:42","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So that when you're going through this spot, if it's not you, it can be the detailer who's looking for details and just ticking.","startTime":"01:07:42","endTime":"01:07:50","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"This has a kick.","startTime":"01:07:50","endTime":"01:07:51","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And then what is the kick dimension?","startTime":"01:07:52","endTime":"01:07:54","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"What is the kick field?","startTime":"01:07:54","endTime":"01:07:55","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"What is the blah, blah.","startTime":"01:07:55","endTime":"01:07:56","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"That's what I need to finalize that.","startTime":"01:07:57","endTime":"01:07:59","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"When we're going through this and we get over to.","startTime":"01:07:59","endTime":"01:08:01","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"New cabinet, You click on new cabinet.","startTime":"01:08:06","endTime":"01:08:13","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Oh, this is cabinet run.","startTime":"01:08:13","endTime":"01:08:14","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But you click on new cabinet and then it has all the things for the

a.","startTime":"01:08:17","endTime":"01:08:19","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So that we have everything granulated.","startTime":"01:08:21","endTime":"01:08:23","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So what we talked about that job summary spec is what I'm already building.","startTime":"01:08:23","endTime":"01:08:28","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah, I like that.","startTime":"01:08:28","endTime":"01:08:29","speaker_name":"Bryan","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"That is a job summary spec.","startTime":"01:08:29","endTime":"01:08:30","speaker_name":"Bryan","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I don't think that it's the task card picture that they'll need, which is okay because I think it's going to generate the.","startTime":"01:08:30","endTime":"01:08:40","speaker_name":"Bryan","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So my goal in what I'm currently working on is when.","startTime":"01:08:42","endTime":"01:08:47","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It's here, it's at this point here.","startTime":"01:08:51","endTime":"01:08:56","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So it's what can you get pre Rhino and what can't you get?","startTime":"01:08:57","endTime":"01:09:02","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Or what do you need after Rhino?","startTime":"01:09:02","endTime":"01:09:03","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah, you tell me.","startTime":"01:09:03","endTime":"01:09:05","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Okay, so.","startTime":"01:09:05","endTime":"01:09:06","speaker_name":"Bryan","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So pre Rhino, we can get this whole job summary.","startTime":"01:09:06","endTime":"01:09:09","speaker_name":"Bryan","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"We can look at the drawings and we can get a total quantity for hardware because we can see

cool.","startTime":"01:37:34","endTime":"01:37:35","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And then once you've done that, how do you drawers and stuff in right

how.","startTime":"01:37:54","endTime":"01:37:56","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"When are you doing that versus when are you drawing, like, the face

like.","startTime":"01:47:17","endTime":"01:47:18","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Okay, so let's say this one here.","startTime":"01:47:18","endTime":"01:47:20","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"What's the face frame look

happens?","startTime":"01:48:27","endTime":"01:48:28","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So maybe the better thing to do at this juncture, which would lead right to a job card

Correct.","startTime":"01:48:44","endTime":"01:48:44","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So the base range needs a PDF

cool.","startTime":"01:48:47","endTime":"01:48:48","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"That is the

from.","startTime":"01:50:00","endTime":"01:50:01","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"From a point of view of, like, if I'm cutting a door, let's

like.","startTime":"01:50:22","endTime":"01:50:23","speaker_name":"Bryan","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"It reinforces my point that each cabinet really should have its own

sense.","startTime":"01:50:30","endTime":"01:50:35","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Because you would isolate yours, you would isolate all the other things from it.","startTime":"01:50:37","endTime":"01:50:41","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Or at worst, why can't you write.","startTime":"01:50:43","endTime":"01:50:45","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"A script where maybe, like, we have a template that has a label up here and then it can identify that within this frame is.","startTime":"01:50:45","endTime":"01:50:53","speaker_name":"Bryan","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And then it can all be in one

saying.","startTime":"01:50:57","endTime":"01:51:00","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Layer all these in here as a room number, a cabinet number or

yeah, I'll think through that.","startTime":"01:51:08","endTime":"01:51:10","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Okay, so back to specs doors we've done right drawers, what are the draw things that you would fill in?","startTime":"01:51:10","endTime":"01:51:17","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Imagine you're doing draws.","startTime":"01:51:17","endTime":"01:51:18","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And what are the of types team or anyone needs to know, including material sourcing, including production.","startTime":"01:51:18","endTime":"01:51:24","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"What notes, what explanations need to be written down.","startTime":"01:51:24","endTime":"01:51:28","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"If we do drawers, we need to know if it's what it's made of.","startTime":"01:51:28","endTime":"01:51:32","speaker_name":"Bryan","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"It needs to be either birch plowed or maple, whether or not it gets a logo burned in.","startTime":"01:51:33","endTime":"01:51:39","speaker_name":"Bryan","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So type burn logo.","startTime":"01:51:39","endTime":"01:51:41","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Okay.","startTime":"01:51:41","endTime":"01:51:42","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"You choose sizes.","startTime":"01:51:43","endTime":"01:51:44","speaker_name":"Bryan","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"What do you mean by size?","startTime":"01:51:45","endTime":"01:51:46","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Because for drawers, we don't make them, we order them.","startTime":"01:51:46","endTime":"01:51:48","speaker_name":"Bryan","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So this is going down a different path to purchasing.","startTime":"01:51:48","endTime":"01:51:51","speaker_name":"Bryan","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So, like for this one here, and it could be drawn this way, but Blum is 5:16 offset from the size of your opening every single time, either side.","startTime":"01:51:52","endTime":"01:52:03","speaker_name":"Bryan","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So is that connected to hardware?","startTime":"01:52:04","endTime":"01:52:07","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yes, it is connected to hardware.","startTime":"01:52:07","endTime":"01:52:09","speaker_name":"Bryan","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So, you know, depth.","startTime":"01:52:10","endTime":"01:52:11","speaker_name":"Bryan","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Depth tells you hardware because it's blunt.","startTime":"01:52:11","endTime":"01:52:12","speaker_name":"Bryan","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And our standard, like we did at the beginning, is Blum 563H slides.","startTime":"01:52:12","endTime":"01:52:18","speaker_name":"Bryan","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Okay, so what I'm hearing is certain hardware determines specifications.","startTime":"01:52:18","endTime":"01:52:24","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Okay.","startTime":"01:52:25","endTime":"01:52:26","speaker_name":"Bryan","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yes.","startTime":"01:52:26","endTime":"01:52:26","speaker_name":"Bryan","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So if attached to a certain Blum piece of hardware.","startTime":"01:52:27","endTime":"01:52:29","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"What are the things that the Blum hardware affects?","startTime":"01:52:31","endTime":"01:52:34","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"What are the things the Blum hardware effects?","startTime":"01:52:35","endTime":"01:52:36","speaker_name":"Bryan","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So let's say that.","startTime":"01:52:37","endTime":"01:52:38","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I'll give you an example.","startTime":"01:52:38","endTime":"01:52:39","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"This is really cool.","startTime":"01:52:39","endTime":"01:52:40","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So we know that Blum hardware is this thick, which means you can't make a drawer.","startTime":"01:52:40","endTime":"01:52:47","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"The drawer has to be thinner based on the overall opening space because the hardware is so like that thick.","startTime":"01:52:47","endTime":"01:52:53","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So I would add to the hardware a minus 0.6 of an inch spec.","startTime":"01:52:53","endTime":"01:53:02","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So if you select that hardware it tells you hey, or in order to duct, that's how it would work.","startTime":"01:53:02","endTime":"01:53:07","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Okay.","startTime":"01:53:09","endTime":"01:53:09","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Okay.","startTime":"01:53:11","endTime":"01:53:11","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So that won't always work because if you have a face frame cabinet here that goes to a European style cabinet and your drawer face, your opening is going to be different and your drawer is offset and you could have two drawers that land on the same divider so that math will be different.","startTime":"01:53:12","endTime":"01:53:27","speaker_name":"Bryan","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So I don't need to know that the map so much as I need to know the field name that you would use to explain that offset.","startTime":"01:53:27","endTime":"01:53:35","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"For example.","startTime":"01:53:35","endTime":"01:53:36","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"What I need to know for drawers is the type.","startTime":"01:53:39","endTime":"01:53:41","speaker_name":"Bryan","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"01:53:41","endTime":"01:53:42","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And the size.","startTime":"01:53:42","endTime":"01:53:43","speaker_name":"Bryan","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah, I get that.","startTime":"01:53:46","endTime":"01:53:47","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And what we can.","startTime":"01:53:47","endTime":"01:53:48","speaker_name":"Bryan","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"01:53:52","endTime":"01:53:52","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And the hardware type.","startTime":"01:53:53","endTime":"01:53:54","speaker_name":"Bryan","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Let's put it there for now.","startTime":"01:53:56","endTime":"01:53:57","speaker_name":"Bryan","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"The reason I'm asking is this.","startTime":"01:53:58","endTime":"01:53:59","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"If I am, let's say

levels.","startTime":"02:27:01","endTime":"02:27:02","speaker_name":"Bryan","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But the idea is that this task can be made for any phase, for any section.","startTime":"02:27:02","endTime":"02:27:09","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And the task can also have tags attached to it like urgent, not

there.","startTime":"02:27:16","endTime":"02:27:19","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And then the idea.","startTime":"02:27:20","endTime":"02:27:21","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It could also be attached to a milestone.","startTime":"02:27:21","endTime":"02:27:23","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So when this task has been completed, I can allow it to move to the next

in.","startTime":"02:27:33","endTime":"02:27:35","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"You can just fill in the title if you wanted to, general tasks.","startTime":"02:27:35","endTime":"02:27:39","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But it's automatically associated to a project

tasks with all the same data.","startTime":"02:27:42","endTime":"02:27:50","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So let's say that we're working on a

sanding.","startTime":"02:28:00","endTime":"02:28:08","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So I'm going to select the cabinet and then I'm going to say, doors need

you.","startTime":"02:28:15","endTime":"02:28:16","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And then everyone will just have a task list just show

out.","startTime":"02:28:33","endTime":"02:28:35","speaker_name":"Bryan","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Because I think it's a great idea.","startTime":"02:28:35","endTime":"02:28:36","speaker_name":"Bryan","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Because then everybody has their own work.","startTime":"02:28:36","endTime":"02:28:38","speaker_name":"Bryan","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But how do I get it so that you can do it?","startTime":"02:28:39","endTime":"02:28:41","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And like, so McKenna, the day before she comes in, if her tasks are already assigned, she knows

right?","startTime":"02:35:50","endTime":"02:35:51","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"02:35:52","endTime":"02:35:52","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Design

this.","startTime":"02:36:28","endTime":"02:36:33","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Okay.","startTime":"02:36:37","endTime":"02:36:37","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So and then you make the overall cabinet card with the tasks.","startTime":"02:36:38","endTime":"02:36:46","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And then from those tasks they can make subtasks.","startTime":"02:36:46","endTime":"02:36:50","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right?","startTime":"02:36:52","endTime":"02:36:52","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"That's what we want.","startTime":"02:36:52","endTime":"02:36:53","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So let's say build cabinet.","startTime":"02:36:53","endTime":"02:36:55","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"They can farm out a subtask.","startTime":"02:36:57","endTime":"02:36:59","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And on that cover sheet I can put all the details, make the

countertop.","startTime":"02:37:03","endTime":"02:37:04","speaker_name":"Bryan","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Okay, so but basically they can get their task and then inside that task they can create subtasks and assign that subtask in some way.","startTime":"02:37:05","endTime":"02:37:13","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"02:37:13","endTime":"02:37:14","speaker_name":"Andrew","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Okay,
