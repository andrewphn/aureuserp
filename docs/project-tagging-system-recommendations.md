# TCS Woodwork ERP - Comprehensive Project Tagging System Recommendations

**Date:** 2025-10-03
**Purpose:** Establish a practical, scalable project tagging system that addresses real pain points from TCS personas
**Total Recommended Tags:** 38 (across 6 categories)

---

## Executive Summary

Based on analysis of TCS Woodwork personas (Owner Bryan, PM David, Lead Craftsman Miguel), workflow documentation, and ERP/construction industry best practices, this document proposes a comprehensive yet manageable tagging system organized into 6 strategic categories.

**Key Principles Applied:**
- **Solve Real Pain Points:** Each tag addresses specific issues identified in persona documentation
- **Avoid Redundancy:** Tags complement existing fields (project_type, lifecycle phases) rather than duplicate them
- **Color Psychology:** Strategic use of colors for quick visual scanning
- **Practical Limit:** 38 total tags keeps system usable, not overwhelming

---

## Tag Categories Overview

| Category | Count | Purpose | Primary User |
|----------|-------|---------|--------------|
| **1. Lifecycle Phase** | 12 | Already created - project workflow stages | All |
| **2. Priority/Urgency** | 5 | Resource allocation and scheduling | Bryan, David |
| **3. Project Health** | 6 | Early warning system for issues | Bryan, David |
| **4. Work Scope/Type** | 7 | Work classification beyond project_type | David, Miguel |
| **5. Risk/Issue** | 5 | Proactive problem tracking | All |
| **6. Quality/Complexity** | 3 | Production planning and resource assignment | Miguel, David |

**Total: 38 tags**

---

## 1. Lifecycle Phase Tags (Already Created ‚úì)

These 12 tags are already in the system and track the project through its workflow stages:

| Tag Name | Color | Status |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Awareness & Contact | #3B82F6 (Blue) | ‚úì Created |
| Intake & Qualify | #8B5CF6 (Purple) | ‚úì Created |
| Bid/Proposal | #EC4899 (Pink) | ‚úì Created |
| Agreement & Contract | #10B981 (Green) | ‚úì Created |
| Kickoff & Deposit | #14B8A6 (Teal) | ‚úì Created |
| Design & Development | #F59E0B (Amber) | ‚úì Created |
| Production | #EF4444 (Red) | ‚úì Created |

## 2. Priority/Urgency Tags (5 tags)

**Purpose:** Address Bryan's need to filter noise and focus on critical items; help David manage competing demands.

**Pain Points Addressed:**
- Bryan: "Constant firefighting, lack of prioritization support"
- David: "Resource conflicts, schedule delays"

| Tag Name | Color | Hex | When to Use | Business Impact |
|----------|-------|-----|-------------|-----------------|
| **üî• Critical Priority** | Bright Red | #DC2626 | Revenue at risk, safety issues, client escalations | Immediate action required |
| **‚ö° High Priority** | Orange-Red | #EA580C | Contractual deadlines, major milestones approaching | Complete within 48 hours |
| **üìã Standard Priority** | Yellow | #EAB308 | Normal workflow, no special urgency | Standard queue processing |
| **üìÖ Low Priority** | Light Gray | #94A3B8 | Nice-to-have, flexible timeline | Complete when capacity allows |
| **‚ùÑÔ∏è On Hold** | Blue-Gray | #475569 | Waiting on client/vendor, paused projects | No active work until unblocked |

**Usage Guidelines:**
- Only 20% of projects should be Critical/High Priority (prevents priority inflation)
- Review priorities weekly to prevent everything becoming "urgent"
- Auto-escalate priority as deadlines approach

---

## 3. Project Health/Status Tags (6 tags)

**Purpose:** Early warning system for Bryan; proactive problem-solving for David; addresses "surprises and lack of communication"

**Pain Points Addressed:**
- Bryan: "Dropping balls, operational chaos, missed follow-ups"
- David: "Client dissatisfaction, budget overruns, schedule delays"

| Tag Name | Color | Hex | Trigger Conditions | Action Required |
|----------|-------|-----|-------------------|------------------|
| **‚úÖ On Track** | Green | #16A34A | Meeting milestones, budget healthy, no blockers | Continue monitoring |
| **‚ö†Ô∏è At Risk** | Yellow | #CA8A04 | Minor delays (<1 week), budget variance <10%, solvable issues | PM attention needed |
| **üö® Red Flag** | Red | #DC2626 | Major delays (>1 week), budget overrun >10%, critical issues | Immediate escalation |
| **‚è∏Ô∏è Blocked** | Purple | #9333EA | Waiting on approvals, materials, client decisions | Daily follow-up required |
| **üí∞ Budget Watch** | Orange | #EA580C | Budget variance 5-10%, trending toward overrun | Cost review meeting |
| **‚è∞ Schedule Watch** | Amber | #F59E0B | Deadline in <2 weeks, dependencies at risk | Resource reallocation |

**Dashboard Impact:** Bryan can filter to show only "At Risk" + "Red Flag" + "Blocked" projects for daily review.

---

## 4. Work Scope/Type Tags (7 tags)

**Purpose:** Complement project_type field with specific work classifications; help Miguel assess buildability and complexity.

**Pain Points Addressed:**
- Miguel: "Poor drawings/specs, rushed schedules compromising quality"
- David: "Scope creep, resource allocation challenges"

**Note:** These work alongside the existing project_type field (Residential, Commercial, etc.)

| Tag Name | Color | Hex | Description | Why Useful |
|----------|-------|-----|-------------|------------|
| **ü™ö Custom Cabinetry** | Brown | #92400E | Built-in cabinets, kitchens, vanities | Shop capacity planning |
| **üèõÔ∏è Architectural Millwork** | Dark Blue | #1E3A8A | Wainscoting, crown molding, trim packages | Finish scheduling |
| **ü™ë Custom Furniture** | Warm Brown | #78350F | Tables, chairs, built-in seating | Different workflow/timeline |
| **üö™ Doors & Casework** | Teal | #115E59 | Custom doors, frames, specialty casework | Hardware coordination |
| **üèóÔ∏è Commercial Fixtures** | Steel Blue | #0F766E | Retail displays, office millwork | Commercial specs/compliance |

| **üé® Finishing Only** | Purple | #7C2D94 | Refinishing, touch-up, finishing services | Schedule around production |

**Usage:** Projects can have multiple work scope tags (e.g., Custom Cabinetry + Custom Furniture).

---

## 5. Risk/Issue Tags (5 tags)

**Purpose:** Proactive tracking of common problems; prevent issues from becoming crises.

**Pain Points Addressed:**
- Bryan: "Quality control issues, rework, financial instability"
- David: "Poor communication, lack of information, scope creep"
- Miguel: "Material issues, unclear standards, repeated team errors"

| Tag Name | Color | Hex | Common Scenarios | Prevention Action |
|----------|-------|-----|------------------|-------------------|
| **üìê Design Risk** | Pink | #DB2777 | Complex/novel designs, unclear specs, multiple revisions | Extra design review, buildability check |
| **üì¶ Material Risk** | Brown | #A16207 | Long lead times, availability issues, quality concerns | Early ordering, backup suppliers |
| **üë• Coordination Risk** | Blue | #2563EB | Multiple stakeholders, GC dependencies, designer conflicts | Communication plan, clear roles |
| **üíµ Payment Risk** | Red-Orange | #DC2626 | Deposit delays, credit concerns, disputed change orders | Strict payment milestones |
| **‚öôÔ∏è Capacity Risk** | Indigo | #4F46E5 | Tight timeline, overlapping projects, specialty skills needed | Resource leveling, outsourcing plan |

**Dashboard View:** Filter by risk tags to see vulnerable projects requiring mitigation plans.

## 6. Quality/Complexity Tags (3 tags)

**Purpose:** Help Miguel plan builds and mentor team; assist David with realistic scheduling.

**Pain Points Addressed:**
- Miguel: "Rushed schedules, quality vs. speed tensions, team skill gaps"
- David: "Unrealistic timelines, production bottlenecks"

| Tag Name | Color | Hex | Criteria | Impact on Workflow |
|----------|-------|-----|----------|-------------------|
| **‚≠ê Standard Complexity** | Green | #16A34A | Proven designs, standard materials, experienced team capable | Normal timeline, standard QC |
| **‚≠ê‚≠ê Advanced Complexity** | Yellow | #CA8A04 | Custom designs, specialty materials, requires lead craftsman | +25% timeline, enhanced QC |
| **‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Master Complexity** | Red | #DC2626 | Novel techniques, exotic materials, Miguel-led builds only | +50% timeline, prototype phase |

**Production Planning:** Miguel can filter by complexity to assign appropriate team members and plan mentoring opportunities.

## Usage Guidelines & Best Practices

### For Bryan (Owner)
**Daily Dashboard Filters:**
```
Priority: Critical Priority OR High Priority
Health: Red Flag OR At Risk OR Blocked
```
This shows only projects needing your attention (typically 10-15% of total projects).

**Weekly Strategic Review:**
```
Risk Tags: Any project with 2+ risk tags
Complexity: Master Complexity projects
Health: Budget Watch OR Schedule Watch
```

### For David (Project Manager)
**Daily Task Queue:**
```
Health: Blocked (resolve blockers first)
Priority: Critical Priority ‚Üí High Priority ‚Üí Standard Priority
```

**Change Order Triggers:**
Automatically apply "Design Risk" tag when project has 3+ design revisions.

**Weekly Coordination:**
Filter by "Coordination Risk" + upcoming milestones to plan stakeholder meetings.

### For Miguel (Lead Craftsman)
**Production Planning:**
```
Scope: Custom Cabinetry OR Architectural Millwork
Complexity: Advanced Complexity OR Master Complexity
Health: NOT Blocked
```

**Mentoring Opportunities:**
Assign "Standard Complexity" projects to journeymen; "Advanced" projects require your oversight.

**Quality Checkpoints:**
All "Master Complexity" projects require your sign-off before QC & Finishing phase.

## Color Psychology & Visual Design

**Why These Colors Matter:**

| Color Family | Use Case | Psychological Impact |
|--------------|----------|---------------------|
| **Reds (#DC2626)** | Critical, urgent, problems | Immediate attention, danger, stop |
| **Oranges (#EA580C)** | High priority, warnings | Caution, important but not critical |
| **Yellows (#EAB308)** | Standard priority, watch items | Awareness, moderate attention |
| **Greens (#16A34A)** | On track, standard work | Safe, proceed, positive status |
| **Blues (#2563EB)** | Information, coordination | Trust, communication, stability |
| **Purples (#9333EA)** | Blocked, special cases | Waiting, different workflow |
| **Grays (#475569)** | Low priority, on hold | Neutral, background, deferred |
| **Browns (#92400E)** | Physical work types | Craftsmanship, materials, production |

---

## Metrics & KPIs to Track

Once implemented, monitor these tag-related metrics:

### Health Metrics
- % of projects in each health status
- Average time to resolve "Blocked" status
- Trend of "At Risk" ‚Üí "Red Flag" conversions

### Priority Distribution
- % of projects by priority level (goal: <20% High/Critical)
- Average time-to-completion by priority
- Priority escalation rate over time

### Risk Management
- Most common risk tags (identify systemic issues)
- Projects with 2+ risk tags (high vulnerability)
- Risk tag ‚Üí actual problem conversion rate

### Complexity Planning
- Average timeline by complexity level
- Team member assignments by complexity
- Complexity vs. profitability analysis

---

## Integration with Existing Systems

### Project Type Field (Existing)
**Keep Using For:** Client/market segmentation
- Residential
- Commercial
- Designer Firm
- General Contractor

**Tags Complement By:** Adding work-specific detail
- Project Type: "Commercial"
- Work Scope Tags: "Custom Cabinetry" + "Commercial Fixtures"

### Lifecycle Phase Tags (Existing)
**Keep Using For:** Workflow progression tracking

**Tags Complement By:** Adding orthogonal information
- Lifecycle Phase: "Production"
- Health: "At Risk"
- Priority: "High Priority"
- Complexity: "Advanced Complexity"

### FilamentPHP Filtering
Tags enable powerful multi-dimensional filtering:
```php
->query(function ($query) {
    return $query->whereHas('tags', function ($q) {
        $q->whereIn('name', ['Critical Priority', 'Red Flag']);
    });
})
```

## Common Tagging Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Complex Commercial Project
**Tags Applied:**
- Lifecycle: "Design & Development"
- Priority: "High Priority"
- Health: "On Track"
- Work Scope: "Commercial Fixtures" + "Custom Cabinetry"
- Risk: "Coordination Risk" (multiple stakeholders)
- Complexity: "Advanced Complexity"

**Why:** Gives complete project snapshot at a glance.

### Scenario 2: Urgent Repair Job
**Tags Applied:**
- Lifecycle: "Intake & Qualify"
- Priority: "Critical Priority"
- Health: "Blocked" (waiting on parts)
- Work Scope: "Service/Repair"
- Risk: "Material Risk"

**Why:** Immediately visible on Bryan's critical dashboard; David knows to expedite parts.

### Scenario 3: High-End Residential Kitchen
**Tags Applied:**
- Lifecycle: "Production"
- Priority: "Standard Priority"
- Health: "On Track"
- Work Scope: "Custom Cabinetry" + "Custom Furniture"
- Complexity: "Master Complexity"

**Why:** Miguel knows he needs to lead this build; David plans extended timeline.

## Migration Plan for Existing Projects

### Bulk Tagging Strategy (First 2 Weeks)

**Week 1: Priority & Health Tags**
1. Auto-tag all projects with deadlines <30 days: "High Priority"
2. Auto-tag projects with budget variance >10%: "Budget Watch"
3. Manual review of active projects for health status

**Week 2: Work Scope & Complexity**
1. Map existing project descriptions to work scope tags
2. Review production history to assign complexity tags
3. PM/Miguel collaboration to validate complexity ratings

### Automated Tagging Rules (To Implement Later)

```php
// Auto-apply "Blocked" when no activity for 7 days
// Auto-escalate priority as deadline approaches
// Auto-apply "Budget Watch" when costs exceed 90% of estimate
// Auto-apply "Schedule Watch" when milestone missed
```

---

## Success Metrics (3-Month Review)

**Quantitative Goals:**
- 95% of active projects properly tagged
- Bryan's daily review time reduced by 40%
- 30% reduction in "surprise" issues/delays
- 25% improvement in on-time project completion

**Qualitative Goals:**
- Team reports clearer priorities
- Less time spent in status meetings
- Improved client communication about project status
- Better resource allocation across shop floor

## Questions & Answers

**Q: Why only 38 tags? Some ERPs have hundreds.**
**A:** Research shows diminishing returns after 30-40 tags. More tags = decision fatigue and inconsistent application. Focus on high-impact categories.

**Q: Can projects have multiple tags from the same category?**
**A:** Yes for Work Scope (a project can be Cabinetry + Furniture). No for Priority (one priority per project). Use judgment for others.

**Q: Who is responsible for tagging projects?**
**A:**
- Lifecycle: Auto-updates with workflow (future enhancement)
- Priority/Health: Project Manager (David) with owner review
- Work Scope: Assigned at intake/bid phase
- Risk: PM identifies during kickoff and weekly reviews
- Complexity: Lead Craftsman (Miguel) during design review

**Q: What if we need a tag that's not in this system?**
**A:** Document the use case, track how often the need arises, and add to system after 5+ instances. Prevents tag proliferation.

**Q: How do tags differ from custom fields?**
**A:** Tags are multi-select, visual, and flexible. Custom fields are single-value, structured data. Use custom fields for data you'll report on (dates, numbers, dropdowns). Use tags for multi-dimensional categorization.
